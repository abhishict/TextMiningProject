Police departments are already switching. Public transit. Delivery fleets (Amazon  etc). Pepsi for Semis. There is no going back.

School bus diesel clouds are horrible  and school buses have hours to charge during the day. EV buses are easier to drive  too. Cheaper to maintain.

(Short of actually outlawing such vehicles, which is not going to happen  and would throw America back decades - look what outlawing new technology does to Europe)

It's not a ""movement"", it's a transition.

Pro-EV,"Can we build a theoretical use case where we assume all negatives, and deny all positives to make ICE seem like a better answer for the truly poor? Yes. 

If we actually talk about real world use cases are EV’s absolutely less expensive to use? Yes. 

You keep mentioning that the cost of electricity is effectively unmonitored credit, and can be devastating to budgeting. But you seem to forget that the cost of gasoline would also be gone at the same time. So, the best way to account for that is to look at cost/mile driven. And here, EV’s shine. The solid, worn, used cars that you’re talking about are getting 10-20 mpg, and with gasoline being $3.00/gallon that makes it 15-30¢/mile for fuel. Then add $40 for an oil change every 3,000 miles and you’re adding another 1.5¢/mile so we could be looking at as much as 32¢/mile to drive an ICE car before insurance registration, and other fixed costs that we can assume will be similar regardless of vehicle power source.  EV’s on the other hand are getting 2-6 miles/kWh depending on how hard you drive them. Flat rate electricity rates (where electricity costs the same regardless of when it is consumed) IN MY AREA is like 13¢/kWh, but with time of use pricing can go as low as 6¢/kWh. That works out to anywhere between 1¢-7¢/mile. Add 0¢/mile for oil changes, and you’re still at 1-7¢/mile. 

So, if we are looking at 16¢/mile as the best case for a somewhat dependable old car, and 7¢/mile as the worst case for an EV, you’re still cutting fuel costs by half. MINIMUM. If you take the middle ground for each, you start looking at 23¢/mile (ICE) vs 4¢/mile for EV, and that means a realistic cut of over 80% of a persons fuel costs. 

Now, if you want to talk about commercial charging, you’re going to see close to 10¢/mile for EV’s which is still significantly lower than gasoline, but the spread is much smaller. There are also ways and places to charge for free, I personally have just under 12,000 miles on my Mach-E in which time I have not used a single kWh that has a cost to me associated with it. It has literally cost me $0.00 for fuel to drive those 12,000 miles, and that wouldn’t change based on the EV I was driving.",build theoretical use case assume negative deny positive ice seem better answer truly poor yes actually talk real world use case absolutely less expensive use yes keep mentioning cost electricity effectively unmonitored credit devastating budgeting seem forget cost gasoline gone time best way account look costmile driven shine solid worn used talking getting mpg gasoline gallon mile fuel add oil change every mile adding another mile could looking much mile drive ice insurance registration fixed cost assume similar regardless power source hand getting mileskwh depending hard drive flat rate electricity rate electricity cost regardless consumed area kwh time use pricing go low kwh work anywhere mile add mile oil change still mile looking mile best case somewhat dependable old mile worst case still cutting fuel cost half minimum take middle ground start looking mile ice v mile mean realistic cut person fuel cost want talk commercial charging going see close mile still significantly lower gasoline spread much smaller way place charge free personally mile mache time used single kwh cost associated literally cost fuel drive mile change based driving,179

In something like Formula 1, yeah it could make some sense since everything is ridiculously weight and space constrained, and the track is controlled and won't have something like potholes.

In a regular car it would be a disaster: every pothole is a threat that could destroy a motor. The motor will bear the brunt of rain, snow, salt, etc and it's almost impossible to protect it from the outside environment. It's crazy expensive.

I've still yet to see what problem in-wheel motors are supposedly solving: there is no shortage of space on a consumer car.

Pro-EV,"the bigger drag on EVs is the fact that aside from Tesla no other charging network can get their act together enough to run an actually reliable network.  As another commenter said, I’ll use alligator clips if it guaranteed I could charge 100% of the time at every station I pull up to and were widely available.

People need to understand the scale difference between Tesla and other chargepoints.  The smallest install I’ve seen with Tesla is a 4-spot at a tiny gas station in the middle of bumblefuck.  Literally a tiny pass through town and it had as many chargers as a standard EA station in a high volume location.  The smallest install I’ve seen in a place where there was any sort of reasonable population is 8 and most of the time it’s 10 or 12 and they are talking about future installs of 20+ as a NORMAL situation.

Tesla understands scale better than any other CPO, and they’re investing for scale.  If that means their standard wins, then I really DGAF because working chargers outweigh any other consideration.  No one will ever buy another EV if their partner pulls up to a station at 11pm in some dark corner of a parking lot only to find neither of the 2 stations work and they don’t have enough charge to get to the next station.",bigger drag fact aside charging network act together enough run actually reliable network another commenter said use alligator clip guaranteed could charge time every pull widely available understand scale difference chargepoints smallest install seen spot tiny gas middle bumblefuck literally tiny pas town many charger standard ea high volume location smallest install seen place sort reasonable population time talking future installs normal situation understands scale better cpo investing scale mean standard win really dgaf working charger outweigh consideration ever buy another partner pull pm dark corner parking lot find neither work enough charge next,94

Pro-EV,"I have some insight into what is happening in Massachusetts. About 3 years ago I finished a 5 year term on my Town's planning board. I helped work on the ""Master Plan"" which is a document that lays out the community's intensions for the near future. It involves a lot of public outreach and consulting with experts. I left before they finished the document, but there were quite a few things that were getting added in relation to EV adoption, solar power generation, and other green technologies.

Every town (i think) in Massachusetts adopts the standard building code, but can add various things to it if they want. With respect to home chargers, it was suggested that we pass a local building code requirement that all new homes be required to, either, have a EV charger installed, or be wired to allow a charger to be installed. I haven't read the final document, so I don't know which got included. Mind you, putting it in the master plan means nothing, it just gives the town officials an idea of what they should propose for a local by-law, which would then have to be voted on by the Town Meeting\* to become an actual building code. The local officials don't move very fast so I haven't heard of this by-law being written or voted on yet, but we were planning to make it happen eventually, along with public EV chargers being required at all new Site Plan Reviews (for commecial, office and industrial sites).

Pro-EV,"I saw a report on a pilot project in a town in Germany. The stations are very well received, but the town is struggling with finding locations to put up more.

For example, they can only use streetlights that are not too far from a power transformer because the buried cabling would be overtaxed if a faraway streetlight started pulling that many amps for long periods of time (they were not specced to handle this kind of load). Another problem: they can't place chargers on streetlights where using them would require stringing the charging cord across pedestrian walkways and bike paths. And of course, there must be parking spaces next to the streetlights, and they must be public spaces that aren't metered. And so on and so forth - the list goes on.

Thus, while the residents want more streetlight chargers, and the town eagerly wants to give them more, the reality is that they're really, really struggling to find more than just a tiny fraction of streetlights that check all the boxes. If new streets were built, with new streetlights, they could be designed out of the box to better support such a use case, but legacy infrastructure is often just not suited to handle streetlight chargers.

So I'd say we're quite far away from this becoming common.",saw report pilot project town germany well received town struggling finding location put example use streetlight far power transformer buried cabling overtaxed faraway streetlight started pulling many amp long period time specced handle kind load another problem place charger streetlight using require stringing charging cord across pedestrian walkway bike path course must parking space next streetlight must public space metered forth list go thus resident want streetlight charger town eagerly want give reality really really struggling find tiny fraction streetlight check box street built streetlight could designed box better support use case legacy infrastructure often suited handle streetlight charger say quite far away becoming common,105

And yes: having that load shifted to nighttime means that there needs to be less in the way of grid augmentation than if most charging were done during the day.

Pro-EV,"Can we build a theoretical use case where we assume all negatives, and deny all positives to make ICE seem like a better answer for the truly poor? Yes. 

If we actually talk about real world use cases are EV’s absolutely less expensive to use? Yes. 

You keep mentioning that the cost of electricity is effectively unmonitored credit, and can be devastating to budgeting. But you seem to forget that the cost of gasoline would also be gone at the same time. So, the best way to account for that is to look at cost/mile driven. And here, EV’s shine. The solid, worn, used cars that you’re talking about are getting 10-20 mpg, and with gasoline being $3.00/gallon that makes it 15-30¢/mile for fuel. Then add $40 for an oil change every 3,000 miles and you’re adding another 1.5¢/mile so we could be looking at as much as 32¢/mile to drive an ICE car before insurance registration, and other fixed costs that we can assume will be similar regardless of vehicle power source.  EV’s on the other hand are getting 2-6 miles/kWh depending on how hard you drive them. Flat rate electricity rates (where electricity costs the same regardless of when it is consumed) IN MY AREA is like 13¢/kWh, but with time of use pricing can go as low as 6¢/kWh. That works out to anywhere between 1¢-7¢/mile. Add 0¢/mile for oil changes, and you’re still at 1-7¢/mile. 

So, if we are looking at 16¢/mile as the best case for a somewhat dependable old car, and 7¢/mile as the worst case for an EV, you’re still cutting fuel costs by half. MINIMUM. If you take the middle ground for each, you start looking at 23¢/mile (ICE) vs 4¢/mile for EV, and that means a realistic cut of over 80% of a persons fuel costs. 

Now, if you want to talk about commercial charging, you’re going to see close to 10¢/mile for EV’s which is still significantly lower than gasoline, but the spread is much smaller. There are also ways and places to charge for free, I personally have just under 12,000 miles on my Mach-E in which time I have not used a single kWh that has a cost to me associated with it. It has literally cost me $0.00 for fuel to drive those 12,000 miles, and that wouldn’t change based on the EV I was driving.",build theoretical use case assume negative deny positive ice seem better answer truly poor yes actually talk real world use case absolutely less expensive use yes keep mentioning cost electricity effectively unmonitored credit devastating budgeting seem forget cost gasoline gone time best way account look costmile driven shine solid worn used talking getting mpg gasoline gallon mile fuel add oil change every mile adding another mile could looking much mile drive ice insurance registration fixed cost assume similar regardless power source hand getting mileskwh depending hard drive flat rate electricity rate electricity cost regardless consumed area kwh time use pricing go low kwh work anywhere mile add mile oil change still mile looking mile best case somewhat dependable old mile worst case still cutting fuel cost half minimum take middle ground start looking mile ice v mile mean realistic cut person fuel cost want talk commercial charging going see close mile still significantly lower gasoline spread much smaller way place charge free personally mile mache time used single kwh cost associated literally cost fuel drive mile change based driving,179

Pro-EV,"Ehhh, I kinda see the opposite. EVs make the most sense for people who do daily commuting and are in that 'sweet spot' of doing enough daily miles that they save a bunch of money on gas, but few enough miles that they can just overnight charge at home. 

As an occasional-use vehicle, EVs are far less attractive - they have a higher up front cost and longer trips are a hassle. If you're not commuting and just using a car for occasional errands and trips, you're not saving any money by going electric. We've driven 3 miles since the lockdown started, so we're not spending any money on gas or electricity. But if I had just bought a Tesla last month, I would have needed to make a $700 car payment. 

Oil prices are down due to the price ear and ICEs are cheaper than ever to run. We're flirting with prices where it's cheaper per mile to *not* plug in your plug-in hybrid (something like the Volt is cheaper per mile on gas once you get below $1.75/gallon, at typical electricity prices)

Plus if this turns into a recession, new car sales are going to go down, especially at the higher end of a market. People have a paid off ICE that they're spending $100/mo in gas and $50/mo in maintenance on, it's a tough sell to switch to an EV that starts a $400-800/mo car payment for 3-7 years and will cost $60/mo in electricity.

Pro-EV,"If the manufacturing process is OK then 'dismantling/repairing' is a non-issue. This is why EV manufacturers are already moving into 'structural batteries' where the batteries become part of the structural integrity of the car (i.e. something that is not intended to be removed/repaired during the lifetime of the car).

The issues with e.g. the batteries in the Bolt or the Kona were due to faulty manufacturing at the battery plant of individual cells - not due to failure modes as a result of operation. High degradation in early Leafs was due to a lack of battery management system (which is a standard feature in EVs today)

Batteries have long warranties (MUCH longer than components in ICE cars). Usually 8 years/100k miles or thereabouts (for comparison: the average lifetime of a car is 150k miles) . Warranty times mean that the company does not expect a significant percentage of the batteries to have to be replaced within that time. The battery is - by far - the most expensive part. So if they would have to replace the battery under warranty in even a small percentage of cars this would immediately kill any profitability of the product - i.e when you buy an EV you can fully expect the battery to last the lifetime of the car.

And at this point, EVs have been around awhile, the bugs have been mostly worked out, and there's not that much room for them to increase dramatically in efficiency. The battery and electric motor technology really isn't that different from that used in hybrids, it's just that more powerful batteries and motors now let you simplify things more by getting rid of the ICE altogether. 

If you want to make a technology comparison, compared to desktop computer processors you could say we're already at the equivalent of something like 2005, when processors were already capable of doing most anything any home user could need, and further refinements would mostly result in them being cheaper and more power efficient, etc. And in powering much smaller devices.

Likewise, the most important improvement in EVs in the coming decade will mostly be in them becoming more competitive in cost with ICE vehicles. They are already quieter, more comfortable, accelerate faster, etc. Smaller, more efficient batteries may eventually reduce overall vehicle weight, but won't have too much benefit beyond that.",technology already much mature really change closer something transition cvt traditional automatic transmission entirely type point around awhile bug mostly worked much room increase dramatically efficiency motor technology really different used hybrid powerful motor let simplify getting rid ice altogether want technology comparison compared desktop computer processor could say already equivalent something processor already capable anything home user could refinement mostly result cheaper power efficient etc powering much smaller device likewise important improvement coming decade mostly becoming competitive cost ice already quieter comfortable accelerate faster etc smaller efficient may eventually reduce overall weight much benefit beyond,96

Pro-EV,"Northvolt–Hydro battery recycling joint venture Hydrovolt has commenced commercial recycling operations at its plant in Fredrikstad, Norway.  


  
Hydrovolt is Europe’s largest electric vehicle battery recycling plant, with capacity to process 12,000 tons of battery packs on annual basis – sufficient to recycle the entirety of the Norwegian end-of-life battery market.  


  
The fully automated recycling process is enabling up to 95% of materials to be recovered from batteries, including black mass which will be supplied to Northvolt for further recycling to support Northvolt’s goal of using 50% recycled material in battery production by 2030.  


  
Aluminium recovered through Hydrovolt will be delivered to Hydro for recirculation into commercial grade aluminium products.  


  
Hydrovolt is exploring an expansion of recycling capacity within Europe, with a long-term target to recycle approximately 70,000 tons of battery packs by 2025 and 300,000 tons of battery packs by 2030.

  
Hydrovolt is Europe’s largest electric vehicle battery recycling plant, capable of processing approximately 12,000 tons of battery packs per year (around 25,000 EV batteries). With the plant now online, a sustainable solution for handling Norway’s entire volume of electric vehicle batteries being retired from the market, or reaching end-of-life, is now available.  


  
Integrated with a novel process design, Hydrovolt can recover and isolate some 95% of the materials in a battery including, plastics, copper, aluminium and black mass (a compound containing nickel, manganese, cobalt and lithium). Several novel concepts designed to maximise recovery of materials are found within the plant, including a dust collection system which ensures valuable material typically lost through mechanical recycling steps is captured.  


  
Hydrovolt is exploring an expansion of recycling capacity within Europe, with a long-term target to recycle approximately 70,000 tons of battery packs by 2025 and 300,000 tons of battery packs by 2030, equivalent to approximately 150,000 EV batteries in 2025 and 500,000 in 2030.  


  
Peter Qvarfordt, CEO of Hydrovolt, comments: “Hydrovolt represents a milestone on Norway’s trailblazing journey towards widespread electric transportation. Norway has been leading the world in adoption of electric vehicles for some years, but what has been missing is recycling capacity to ensure a sustainable solution for those batteries as they reach end-of-life. Today, Hydrovolt is scaled to handle the entire volume of end-of-life batteries in Norway, but we’re now looking towards expanding to ensure we’re prepared for the higher flows of batteries we know are coming.”  


  
Arvid Moss, Executive Vice President in Hydro, comments: ""Batteries play a key role in the world’s transition to renewable energy. Through Hydrovolt, we are laying the foundations for a sustainable and circular supply chain for batteries in Europe. Batteries reaching end-of-life will get a new life through the recovery of black mass and aluminium. Aluminium can be recycled with only 5% of the initial energy required to produce primary aluminium, which makes it a perfect material for a circular economy.""  


  
The recycling of batteries will contribute directly to the sustainability of the battery industry and is necessary for fulfilment of emerging European regulations governing batteries, including forthcoming mandatory recycling targets.  


  
Significantly, the recovery of black mass – a powder containing metals of nickel, manganese, cobalt and lithium – will reduce today’s dependence on mining as a source for primary raw materials, and all the relative risks and vulnerabilities associated with it.  


  
Emma Nehrenheim, Chief Environmental Officer of Northvolt, comments: “Recycling end-of-life batteries is a cornerstone to ensuring the electric vehicle transition is a true success from an environmental perspective. The metals used in battery production are finite, but by substituting raw materials mined from the Earth with recycled materials we can not only cut the carbon footprint of batteries but enable the sustainable long-term use of lithium-ion battery technology.”  


  
Processing black mass into battery-grade material requires a hydrometallurgical treatment such as is being established at Northvolt’s Revolt Ett recycling plant in Skellefteå, Sweden.

Pro-EV,"Meanwhile in shareholder / government (aka shareholder) land, it's widely known that only expensive BEVs replacing ICEVs can fix the environment.  If you think differently, then buying some shares should fix you up quick, fast, and in a hurry. /s

Seriously though... commuter based emissions make up the lion's share of transportation based emissions.

If everyone on the planet commuted by bike 1 day per week on average (biking more in non-winter months and less in winter), then commuting based emissions would drop by about 20% world wide.  Outside of setting up some protected bike lanes (which may just require a bit of paint and some poles drilled into the cement), and people buying inexpensive e-bikes, this could be accomplished in literally a few years.  Meanwhile, BEVs will take \~20-30 years to replace ICEVs.

For a person with a 30 mile daily commute, an e-bike would require about 1 kWh of energy to make the trip.  BEVs require \~7.5 kWh.  7.5x as much energy.  That's before getting into the massive amount of mining and energy the manufacturing of BEVs requires versus the manufacturing of e-bikes.

Add in a 4 day work week with all non-essential retail businesses (grocery stores) shutting down once a week, and now you can subtract another 20% of commuter based emissions.  We're up to a 40% drop in commuter based emissions from these two policies alone.

Add in a mandatory work from home day once a week for office workers, and now all office workers see their commuter based emissions drop another 20%.  Suddenly office workers have now reduced 60% of their commuter based emissions.

All car owners have extended the life of their cars and reduced vehicle maintenance, leading to light-duty vehicles lasting longer, and fewer produced per year.  That's less mining, energy use, and emissions/pollution.  This will necessarily kill jobs; but unlike BEVs that kill at least 30% of automotive jobs without direct replacements, bikes will necessarily add a lot of new retail jobs back.

Pro-EV,">Electric batteries require mining lithium, cobalt and other metals that have devastating environmental impacts

Newer battery technologies use little to no cobalt. Lithium isn't really ""mined"" it is extracted from heavy brine sources but that just means evaporating off the excess water. Mining other resources are not more damaging or impactful than oil drilling and refinement. 

>use child labour (I think we'll need to increase this mining upwards of 6 times if we all start using EV's)

New mining is primarily in countries or regions that have strong child labor laws. As mentioned above, cobalt mining is being less important for battery production and most, if not all, car manufacturers are changing to source raw materials outside of areas like central Africa that use child labor. 

>ICE cars, while using fossil fuels, are more efficient than ever, have carbon filters, are reliable for short and long journeys, and with proper maintenance can last decades.

ICE efficiency improvements have slowed and are near a plateau due to the limitations of energy capture from the combustion process in a small engine.

EVs are just as reliable or more reliable than ICE vehicles and no matter how you cut it the long term environmental impact is significantly less than any mass market ICE vehicle is capable of. 

And you point to ""proper maintenance"", that relies on billions of people properly maintaining their vehicles for decades, that is a pipe dream. EVs even running inefficiently are multiple times more efficient than ICE vehicles in energy use. 

>And the electricity to charge EV's usually comes from fossil fuels anyway, so really the only thing it's helping reduce is air pollution, but then when the batteries overheat they can start uncontrollable fires and explosions that choke the air with smoke and chemicals.

Not accurate at all. It is very location dependent but areas like California that have the highest EV adoption rates have the much of their energy production renewable sources, nuclear that doesn't pollute, or low emissions natural gas.

And the ratio of CO2 emissions sources to green sources is shifting more to green sources every year. 

That is the important thing with EVs, there are options to have sources of clean non-polluting energy. Unlike ICE vehicles that will always have to burn fuel and emit some kind of exhaust by their very nature.

I'm not sure what is up with the one you rented but I had no problems with the headrest and my shoulders and all that.

I also found the same problems you found with AutoPilot. It makes some *strange* decisions at times when traveling at speed in moderate traffic.

The 33 year-old married homeowner in me tells you that it's stupid, childish, and you'd be better off saving that money until you're older ""just in case""... but there's still a teenage boy running around in here. And he's slapping the old guy around like ""DUDE IT'S A FUCKIN' LAMBO LET THE KID LIVE"" 

I read through your posts, you're around 18-20 years old, making $70k pre-tax in Canada. Ok, let's do some fuckin' math! 

$70k pre-tax is... $55,200 after tax in Ontario, and that's with a 0% contribution to RRSP (not a good idea, but it's **your** money)

So you buy an $80k supercar, on a loan (so you *must* have full coverage), as a teenager. Dude your insurance is going to be $1k/mo, or more. No joke. Not because you're a shitty driver, but because teenagers as a whole are shitty drivers. That's a fact, sorry. 

Shit, let's be generous and say that insurance is a mere $10k/year. You're left with $45,200. You need to pay rent. Since you're gonna be living in the Lambo, your 30m² shack on the railroad tracks above the highway next to the airport is $400/mo. Utilities and internet are another $100, that's $6k/year. Now you're down to $39,200, and you haven't even made a payment, let alone the *down* payment. 

Let's say you can pull $20k out of your ass just for the sake of argument, so your down payment does not affect your salary. [CIBC](https://www.cibc.com/ca/loans/calculators/car-loan-calculator.html) says your payment on an $80k car w/ $20k down at 2.74% for 60 months (good rate! You won't get that rate. You're a teenager. Welcome to how fucking unfair shit really is) is $1,274/mo. Let's round that up to $1300 'cause I'm lazy and I like whole numbers, and really you ain't getting 2.74% on a used Lambo. That's another $15,600/year in payments. So you're up to $25k/year just to drive the damn thing, not including the gas and general wear-and-tear. 

You've got a shack, and a Lambo, and still have $24k left over. Awesome! Oh wait you gotta eat. Shit, that's $200/mo if you eat like shit, so now you have $22k. Need clothes? Toothpaste? Toilet paper? Drugs? Guns? Booze? A date with a girl? That's all gonna cost you something. 

After a year, you'll have paid off a whopping 20% of the loan. So you either have to keep it up for five years, or sell it and take the hit. *Maybe* you can get back out what you put in, but how many people who want to buy a Lambo are going to buy one from a teenager? No offense, but I sure as hell wouldn't. I wouldn't buy one from *me*, and I'm 33 and lame as fuck. 

The reality of the situation is that yes, you could own a used Lambo, if it was *literally* the only thing you wanted to own. No house, no retirement plan, none of that shit. 

I almost did it (not with a Lambo, but a Benz) when I was around your age. I was making bank, living with my folks, had no bills and was clearing $60k/year after tax in 2002. Instead, I dumped 25% of my salary into a 401(k), watched the market die, come back, die again, come back again, and now I'm a fucking millionaire.

Pro-EV,"> Nov 16 (Reuters) - Redwood Materials has signed a long-term contract to supply Toyota Motor (7203.T) with recycled materials for the Japanese automaker's $13.9 billion North Carolina electric vehicle battery plant, Redwood said Thursday.

> The Nevada-based materials specialist said it would remanufacture EV battery components from materials supplied by Toyota and recycled from end-of-life vehicles, mainly hybrid-electric models such as the Prius.

> Redwood, one of the world's leading battery recyclers, did not disclose details on value or timing of the agreement.

> In an interview, Redwood Chief Executive J.B. Straubel, a co-founder and a director of global EV leader Tesla (TSLA.O), said the new contract will enable Redwood's business ""to grow and expand with Toyota's future needs.""

> ""We want to be a solution for them for years to come,"" Straubel said. ""I expect they'll be continuing to grow that plant and maybe others.""

> Straubel has said Redwood is building a closed-loop, or circular, battery ecosystem aimed at lowering EV costs by lessening dependence on imported materials while reducing the environmental impact.

> Redwood aims to build annual battery component production capacity in the U.S. of 100 gigawatt-hours -- enough to supply more than 1 million EVs a year, with the long-range option to expand annual capacity to 500 GWh.

> Straubel, formerly Tesla's chief technology officer, founded Redwood in 2017. The company has raised $2 billion at a valuation of $5.25 billion, according to investor website PitchBook, and has negotiated a Department of Energy-backed $2 billion loan.

> Straubel said the company will supply battery components to Toyota from its Sparks, Nevada facility and eventually from a $3.5 billion facility it is building outside Charleston, South Carolina.

> Redwood will sell remanufactured cathode active material, made from recycled lithium, nickel and cobalt, as well as anode foil made from recycled copper. Those two components represent a majority of the cost of current lithium-ion cells.

> Several companies have announced plans to make battery components in North America, to take advantage of incentives built into the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and similar legislation aimed at reducing imports of batteries and materials from China.

There are two basic objectives that we want to achieve with cars from a ecological perspective.  1. Fuel consumption and 2. Emissions.


The smartest way to influence these two things with taxes is 1. Tax consumer fuel by the gallon, liter, etc.  If your car uses a lot of fuel, you are going to pay more.  If it uses less, you save money.  It's a pretty simple equation.

2. Tax manufacturers on the creation of greenhouse gases from exhaust.  If a car generates dirtier exhaust, then it is taxed more heavily and will be more expensive to produce.  If the car has a much cleaner exhaust, then it is much cheaper to produce.

If you have a 6.2L V8 engine with active cylinder management (and runs on 4 cylinders a lot of the time) then it doesn't really matter what the displacement is. It will generate emissions more on par with much smaller displacement engines.  

Whatever you incentivize/subsidize, you will get more of.   If you offer incentives on cleaner exhaust, you will get more cleaner engines with cleaner exhaust.   If you incentivize smaller engines, you will get more smaller engines...but you won't necessarily get cleaner exhaust.

Thr goal isn't smaller engines, or less horsepower.  The goal is more efficient, cleaner engines.  So tax efficiency with fuel tax and tax cleanliness with emissions tax.  Pretty simple.

The cost appeal, if any, should be about deleting the necessity of going to, and paying fuel markup to, a third party middleman for fuel. 

They're also not selling the convenience of never having to bother with burning random Saturday mornings doing drive train maintenance (oil changes), and the convenience of home fueling.

The really big mistake I think they're making is designing the vehicles to be interchangeable and upgrade-able in ways that are as simple as building a PC. They should be at least offering really bare-bones EVs with battery packs that are upgrade-able (and physically re-configurable) as easily as pulling up the seat and snapping additional battery capacity. It should be like adding RAM into a PC. There should be assorted power levels of motors available that are interchangeable between vehicle models in a given manufacturer line, if even interchangeable between manufacturers.

One of the great pitfalls in modern cars is that their complexity detracts from the ability of tinkerers to work on them. EVs can have a clear advantage here if they're made as modular as a PC.

Pro-EV,"Short answer - an economy / polity (the conjoined twins) is best viewed as grossly similar to a type of neural network, an ecosystem, or any living system - in other words a [Complex Adaptive System](https://integratedspaceanalytics.com/cms/plan/integrated-space-plan-2015). Some argue that CAS is either a euphemism for, or actually the definition of, life.

So while TL;DR, from what I did read I think you are on the right track. An economy of any type will evolve always toward the most efficiently and dynamically adaptive state, which is most like a rain forest (or desert depending on resource availability. All of the machinations of leaders whether in government or industry are twiddling on the margins.

The fundamental rule, in various forms, comes down to the Inverse Power Law. See Pareto, Lorentz, Gini, Zipf. Dictatorship or monopoly are two aspects of the same thing, which requires ever-increasing efforts (I.e energy and power) to maintain against the drift toward an inverse power distribution. Similarly, a monoculture like a wheat field or pure socialist utopia can only be maintained by weeding, fertilizing, seed management, suppression of dissent, etc. or it will go back to the jungle. (Yes I am mixing metaphors, to illustrate the commonality of life and economies+polities.)

A classic characteristic of all socialist or central control economies is that the lack of effective feedback inside the system via prices etc. results in the feedback traveling through the political system via bribes, rent-seeking, and other ways of manipulation of the power structure. The extent to which economic entities - people, companies, etc. - succeed by political influence is a direct indicator.  (This is not necessarily all bad though.)

In the end, just as neural networks are a special case of differential equations and fluid dynamics, so also economies are, in the final analysis, subject to the same physics.  See also a fun book, ""The Edge of Chaos"" - controversial but well worth reading for a new perspective on all this 'Life' stuff.",short answer economy polity conjoined twin best viewed grossly similar type neural network ecosystem living system word complex adaptive system argue ca either euphemism actually definition life tldr read think right track economy type evolve always toward efficiently dynamically adaptive state rain forest desert depending resource availability machination leader whether government industry twiddling margin fundamental rule various form come inverse power law see pareto lorentz gini zipf dictatorship monopoly two aspect requires everincreasing effort ie power maintain drift toward inverse power distribution similarly monoculture wheat field pure socialist utopia maintained weeding fertilizing seed management suppression dissent etc go back jungle yes mixing metaphor illustrate commonality life economiespolities classic characteristic socialist central control economy lack effective feedback inside system via price etc result feedback traveling political system via bribe rentseeking way manipulation power structure extent economic entity etc succeed political influence direct indicator necessarily bad though end neural network special case differential equation fluid dynamic economy final analysis subject physic see fun book edge chaos controversial well worth reading perspective life stuff,171

1) Land used for solar and wind is not necessarily single use.  Wind farms can also be used for grazing.  Solar panels do not have to be exclusive placed in large installations, but could be put on roof tops of homes and businesses, making it harder for power companies to use monopoly power to dictate prices.

Having lived through Enron & company blackmailing California out of more than $10 billion, neutering monopolies is pretty high on my criteria for new energy sources.  If the power company charges too much, it's easy enough to slap some solar panels on your roof.  It's not as easy to build your own nuclear power plant.

2) Neither has to be used exclusively to have a positive impact on global warming and pollution.  If you use it where it is feasible and use older forms of generation where it is not or at night, you would still substantially cut down greenhouse gases and pollution.

3) Have you been to the Southwestern or Mountain states?  We have an awful lot of land that we currently use for raising tumbleweeds and rattlesnakes.

This was also exacerbated by the prices being too high in 2021-2022. Owners overpaid for the cars and so when Tesla had large prices cuts in 2023 that meant the owners couldn’t sell their cars to break even on their loans. This situation affected ICE owners as well but ICE manufacturers weren’t cutting prices as far. Also because Tesla has 55% market share for EVs in the U.S., when they cut prices that far it hits the entire EV sector in the U.S.

Pro-EV,"Mining (not just for batteries, but for anything, including fossil fuels) can have pretty significant local environment impact, from disturbing the local environment, to leaching of harmful chemicals used in extraction). The degree of the impact often depends on local regulations and how well they're enforced (a mine in Canada is very different from a mine in Nigeria).

Quantifying the risks and benefits are challenging though. I've seen a lot of anti-EV propaganda highlighting environmental damage mining can do, but rarely/never do they actually compare that to the damage done by ICE production, fossil fuel extraction, and GHG emissions. That's not an easy 1-to-1 comparison because mining impacts can be significant, but they tend to be relatively localized. Fossil fuel extraction impacts are also significant and localized, but GHG emissions are significant and global.    

A few things I believe to be true:    
1) We have to get off fossil fuels. The damage and risks from GHG emissions are just too great. Maintaining the status quo (ICE vehicles) is not an option.    
2) We need to do more to reduce the impacts of material extraction for batteries, including involving indigenous people in the decisions, strengthening regulations, and improving recycling rates drastically.    
3) EVs (while an important piece of the puzzle) are not a silver bullet. A lot more needs to be done to reduce reliance on cars. E.g. public transit, walkable communities. Cars have a lot of negative impacts beyond tail pipe emissions, and EVs while better are not free of negative impacts.

Pro-EV,"Long post, but.....

It's all possible, but we live in a ***very*** complicated and connected environment.  Yes, we could replace ICE vehicles with electric, but that has plenty of downsides as well.  And capitalism isn't necessarily all bad.  It just needs serious guard rails.  It kind of boils down to ***awareness*** and ***priorities*** (global, not personal).  Here are some issues to consider:

* Fossil fuels have a much higher energy density than renewables, making it already an uphill climb if we are just going to replace ICE vehicles with electric.
* Externalities are a thing, and usually left to the consumer/society to deal with.  There is a huge landfill mound just north of Hartford, CT that was just a field 40 years ago.  Whoever made the stuff in it likely didn't pay for its disposal.  And, if I'm not mistaken, Germany has some kind of regulation where the manufacturer of refrigerators are required to take them back and the end of their life.  And many countries in the EU have minimum requirements for recyclable components.
* Scalability is a thing, too.  We need to understand the sheer scope of the task at hand.  Just in the US (assuming that my quick search of number of households that use fossil fuels directly for heat is correct at 40M), if we are to meet the goal of using heat pumps for these cases by 2050, we would need to manufacture almost 6,000 heat pumps every working day.  
* And last, but not least, on the hit list:  time.  Every day we delay a serious attempt at solving the issue(s) means we have a steeper hill to climb, and, at some point, the hill will become too steep.  (This is where capitalism fails, and in some ways inhibits progress.)  There are so many moving parts to the solutions that all developments need to be planned as you would a major construction effort (because it is).  Just in the US, 80M houses will need way more insulation than they have.  40M houses will need conversion to heat pumps or other alternative heat sources.  Charging stations will need to be planned and constructed to handle the new load.  The electric grid needs to be updated.  (In Vermont, they put a limit on grid tied solar panels because the grid couldn't handle it.)

And my last comment is this:  We really need to rethink HOW and WHY we do what we do.  Instead of just living like we always have and replacing things with like things, let's think about how we can do stuff differently and more sustainably.  Even if we replace ICE cars with electric, we're still throwing away about 300M tires per year.  How can we adjust our habits/processes so issues like this are no longer issues.  Again, just being aware of the moving pieces will help a lot.  

Do I think we (collectively) will get to this point in time?  Sadly, no.  We're aiming to keep the CO2 warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2050. Recent reporting from a number of sources indicate that we will blow past that in the next decade.   Will the earth survive?  Yup.  Will society as we know it survive?

What those criticisms you mention SHOULD point to is that we shouldn't blindly assume solar and battery will solve everything. They however should still be very clear that they are better than our current power systems. Cause guess what, the fossil fuel industry also has huge negative externalities that are not CO2e related.

It all depends on the framing. I love to bash on electric cars because, guess what, they are still individual cars. Any public transportation service will be better than individual cars. Even if the public transportation uses fossil fuels and the individual car is electric. So, that's a criticism not of electric vehicles, but of the idea of electric vehicles being a silver bullet, when public transportation is often a much better solution.

So, bottomline? Don't trust someone if they criticize solar and EVs without caveats. They may be pushing an agenda, or missing the forest for the trees. Do trust them if they are just pointing out that solar and EVs are no silver bullets and need to also be looked at critically. Aknowledge the failings of renewables and battery tech, while also keeping in mind that fossil fuels are orders of magnitude worse.",hmm well sustainability concept clear applied sustainability still pipe dream everything tradeoff criticism mention point blindly assume solar solve everything however still clear better current power system guess fossil fuel industry huge negative externality coe related depends framing love bash guess still individual public transportation service better individual even public transportation us fossil fuel individual criticism idea silver bullet public transportation often much better solution bottomline trust someone criticize solar without caveat may pushing agenda missing forest tree trust pointing solar silver bullet looked critically aknowledge failing renewables tech keeping mind fossil fuel order magnitude worse,96

Pro-EV,">when you factor in the energy used and emissions created by their production it can end up being the same or worse for the environment than regular vehicles

This wasn't true [when those claims were first aimed at the Prius](https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/2kou6r/does_anyone_know_what_happens_to_the_batteries/clnlkue/), and this isn't true [for EVs now either](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903729a).  Properly-done lifecycle analyses, like those [the Union of Concerned Scientists](https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-reichmuth/new-data-show-electric-vehicles-continue-to-get-cleaner), [Transport & Environment](https://www.transportenvironment.org/press/electric-cars-emit-less-co2-over-their-lifetime-diesels-even-when-powered-dirtiest-electricity), and Notter et al (linked to earlier) demonstrate that EVs have a lower carbon footprint than normal cars even if you account for the batteries.

Pro-EV,"Kinda hard to say without knowing where you live and how big a house you want. But

The fundamental rule is maximise south facing windows, install eves to protect from the sun in summer and minimise all other windows. 
This will maximise solar gain in winter and prevent it in summer.
Draft-stop and insulate to retain / prevent heat loss / gain.
Will be super comfortable without large temperature fluctuations.

Once that’s done look at your energy usage. Usually heating and cooling are highest.
For a farm, I’m guessing you’ve got heaps of wood around so a wood heater will be best and cheapest. Will last forever too.
Look into traditional heaters but also rocket stoves and  pellet burners.
Can even install a wet back system to heat your hot water in winter.
If your house is huge you could put in hydronic underfloor heating  powered by the wood burner to heat other parts of the house but this is quite expensive and maybe overkill depending how cold it gets where you are.

Solar EVT for hot water. Back it up with the wet back system.

LED lighting.

Induction cooking or wood stove.

Energy efficient appliances. Especially look for ones with a timer that you can time to come on when the sun is shining.

Solar PV with small battery and stay on the grid. Going off grid requires a lot larger solar PV and battery systems to provide for long cloudy periods.
If you minimise the amount of equipment that runs on electricity, especially the heating and cooling equipment, your PV system won’t need to be very big.

You could even look at installing a wind turbine if you have the space and a decent wind resource.

My cabin is powered by just a 400 watt solar power system and I have all the normal appliances most homes have but no grid power.

Because it is well insulated for hot summers and cold winters I use just a small evap cooler and fans in summer and a small wood stove or propane heater in winter. (propane is 99.8% efficient).

Take power production for example. It’s going to be very hard to enter a market where every other business has had years and years to make themselves more profitable.

Pro-EV,"This is so exciting! Good on you for wanting to make a change! I have a lot of suggestions that I really think you’ll like.

1) Buy products from Etsy as opposed to Amazon, the company is carbon neutral, the businesses are small (thus generally more sustainable), and the items are either handmade or vintage. Just be sure not to get scammed lol, perhaps stick to shopping in your continent. I also know this isn’t necessarily an option if you don’t have the money.
2) Stop eating meat. If you can’t make the commitment, maybe start flexitarian, then pescatarian, then vegetarian, then vegan if you’re able. 
3) Stop using plastic bags and cling wrap! They make great reusable silicone baggies and bowl/dish covers. The key here is silicone, although plastic is alright if that’s all you can afford. Once again, I recommend Etsy for low waste items like these.
4) Buy any new clothing, dishes, etc second-hand. A big piece of a sustainable earth is a circular economy. Don’t buy new unless you have to (but also, you’re human, don’t feel ashamed if you treat yourself once in a blue moon.
5) If you wash your face and/or need to remove makeup, use reusable cotton rounds with micellar water (for makeup removal) or cotton face towels. Basically, don’t use any single use items on your face anymore.
6) Switch to toothpaste in an aluminum tube, like Hey Human toothpaste (I think that’s the brand name?).
7) If you want a single serve drink, purchase the ones not in plastic. For example, if you need a pre-made coffee, buy Starbucks in the glass containers instead of Dunkin in the plastic. Same goes for teas and juices, Nantucket Nectars, Honest Tea, and Snapple are a toss up, sometimes they’re plastic but other times they are glass.
8) Bring a reusable cup when you get coffee or tea. I do admit this is less convenient and not very possible right now with the pandemic.
9) Refuse plastic silverware during takeout, bring your own from home or purchase non-plastic collapsible ones.
10) I could be off about this one, but from my experience, powder laundry detergent comes in less plastic than liquid. Plus, let’s be honest, the liquid is a waste of water. Alternatively they make eco-friendly pods or sheets, but that can get pricey fast imo.
11) Buy your chapstick and deodorant in compostable packaging. Some companies like Old Spice and Dove are slowly implementing this, but also you can look to Etsy.
12) See if any products you use have a return program, either with Terracyle or on their own. The production of plastic is bad in and of itself however this is a good way to get rid of the packaging you already have or that other people have who won’t make the switch.
13) Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shave cream…all of it can be found in bar form. If you’re interested, I can send you the link to the shampoo bar I use, it’s super amazing.
14) If you get soft plastic bags for any reason (bread, shopping, toilet paper packaging, etc) you can return them to most stores and they’ll get recycled. Usually there’s a spot for them next to the trash and regular recycling. Target, Walmart, and Costco all do bag recycling for sure.
15) Turn off lights when you don’t need them
16) If you have the money, opt for bamboo toilet paper.
17) Bring your own takeout containers to restaurants instead of using their single-use plastic/styrofoam ones
18) Donate and sell your old items before just trashing them, if you really must get rid of them to begin with
19) Buy in bulk, it’s less plastic overall. For example, if you eat yogurt, buy the large 48oz tub instead of the individual servings.
20) A lot of local  recycling programs (in the USA) accept most plastics nowadays. I’m talking shampoo bottles, cleaning supply bottles, plastic coffee cups, yogurt containers, and anything else with a number of 1-7. I checked with my local recycling plant, check with yours before you trash the plastics you have. Once again, avoiding plastics to begin with is better, but if you have them at least try to recycle them.
21) Compost! Food in landfills don’t break down well and end up producing methane.
22) They make slightly more sustainable cotton swabs that really aren’t more expensive than the regular. I personally don’t favor the reusable silicone ones.
23) This one’s tiny and a given, but I’ll still say it—reusable straws.
24) Stop buying napkins and paper towels, use reusable napkins and rags instead
25) Also a given, but—reusable shopping bags are a must. /any bag that won’t break on you, you don’t have to go out and buy new things.
26) If you buy produce/veggies, buy them individually (instead of in prepackaged plastic) and use reusable mesh baggies.
27) Buy cleaning concentrates that mix with water in reusable bottles instead of buying pre-made stuff.
28) Make the switch to plant milk instead of dairy, or at least lower your consumption of dairy (Say you buy 1 gallon of milk a week, maybe switch to half a gallon regular milk and half a gallon plant milk).
29) If you have the time and energy, make your own snacks instead of buying prepackaged ones. For example, air pop your own popcorn kernals instead of buying microwave popcorn.
30) Buy jam/jelly in glass containers instead of plastic. Same goes for pasta sauce and, well, anything else that comes in a jar.
31) Bulk stores, if they happen to be near you, are your friend.
32) Borrow/rent instead of buying when you can, such as suits or dresses.

The cost savings of energy efficiency actually improve the higher energy costs become. Same with fuel efficiency. The more expensive something becomes the greater your savings are when you reduce consumption of it.  
  
Additionally the material fatigue of the repeated heating and cooling cycles of traditional, less energy efficient lighting, contribute to the rate at which light fixtures wear out.

Pro-EV,"We have to do better than that.  First we have to use our technology wisely.  For instance, there are million of tonnes of e-waste around the World.  A sizeable chunk of that is waste from Ev's, wind turbines and solar cells.  We have to think beyond reuse and recycling.  For instance there is a way to recycle Ev's used batteries to store electricity from solar/wind power.  Great but what happens to them after that.  They are dumped.

Public transport is useless unless there is regular buses within say 15 minutes of each other and you may need more that one on the same Route.  Would your Boss put up with you being constantly late for work?

Ev's are not the total answer either.  They are constructed from plastics, resins and rubber.  All products from the oil industry.

Any product you like to name requires input from the oil industry.  Say let's replace a plastic straw with a paper one.  Great getting rid of plastic.  First we need a tree to make paper.  That tree has to be cut down and transported to the timber mill.  This requires petrol, diesel and oil.

Pro-EV,"There is no comparison to the power of legislative / policy actions that limit and reduce our activities which are harmful to the environment. People who believe they do good for the environment may be less likely to perform a potentially more impactful action later on, like voting or protesting. Look up self-licensing and the moral credential effect.

I had a friend who asked me why I didn't buy a hybrid. It was important to him that ""everyone do their part"". So I ran the numbers.

In Canada, with data ranging from 2015 - 2022, the average person emits 19 tonnes of GHGs per year. Approximately 12.5% of that is on a personal vehicle, or 2.5 tonnes per year. Changing from a gas to hybrid vehicle could improve that to 1.5 tonnes, an overall personal improvement of 8% - not bad.

Compare this to Sweden, with only 4.5 tonnes emitted per person per year thanks to countless government policies which encourage low GHG emissions.

It's not even comparable. 19 tonnes to 4.5. You don't get to one quarter the emissions by buying a hybrid, using biodegradable soap, or whatever else some marketing department wants you to spend your money on.

Canada could cut its per capita GHG emissions by 25% by modernizing residential building code to meet base LEED certification (very rough calculations). But this is not what we're doing, because the large home building corporations would fight it tooth and nail. 

Instead, in Canada, we have the Greener Homes Grant, which offers a variety of rebates for improvements to a person's home's energy efficiency. Almost none are cost effective to the consumer. Of the four people I know who participated in the program, two made significant upgrades - notably, retiring their gas furnaces and ACs for heat pumps. Both said the upgrades were not financially beneficial to them, but that they wanted to do it as they wanted to make an impact. Both of their households likely earn in the top 10% in the country. You can probably see why a program like this is problematic.

Of course BP would rather you spend your personal money to buy whatever the heck you want. If 1% of the top 10% of Canadians (by earnings) switch to electric heat pumps, big deal. The point is that they later voted for parties that won't threaten their bottom line with major policy changes.

It's not just carbon-neutral; it's carbon-*negative* and sequesters co2.  Traditional waste processing plants can't create fertilizer due to parasite concerns, which is where the pyrolysis comes in.

MAERSK (the shipping company) has made a commitment to reduce co2 emissions by 50% by 2050.

Pro-EV,"This is so exciting! Good on you for wanting to make a change! I have a lot of suggestions that I really think you’ll like.

1) Buy products from Etsy as opposed to Amazon, the company is carbon neutral, the businesses are small (thus generally more sustainable), and the items are either handmade or vintage. Just be sure not to get scammed lol, perhaps stick to shopping in your continent. I also know this isn’t necessarily an option if you don’t have the money.
2) Stop eating meat. If you can’t make the commitment, maybe start flexitarian, then pescatarian, then vegetarian, then vegan if you’re able. 
3) Stop using plastic bags and cling wrap! They make great reusable silicone baggies and bowl/dish covers. The key here is silicone, although plastic is alright if that’s all you can afford. Once again, I recommend Etsy for low waste items like these.
4) Buy any new clothing, dishes, etc second-hand. A big piece of a sustainable earth is a circular economy. Don’t buy new unless you have to (but also, you’re human, don’t feel ashamed if you treat yourself once in a blue moon.
5) If you wash your face and/or need to remove makeup, use reusable cotton rounds with micellar water (for makeup removal) or cotton face towels. Basically, don’t use any single use items on your face anymore.
6) Switch to toothpaste in an aluminum tube, like Hey Human toothpaste (I think that’s the brand name?).
7) If you want a single serve drink, purchase the ones not in plastic. For example, if you need a pre-made coffee, buy Starbucks in the glass containers instead of Dunkin in the plastic. Same goes for teas and juices, Nantucket Nectars, Honest Tea, and Snapple are a toss up, sometimes they’re plastic but other times they are glass.
8) Bring a reusable cup when you get coffee or tea. I do admit this is less convenient and not very possible right now with the pandemic.
9) Refuse plastic silverware during takeout, bring your own from home or purchase non-plastic collapsible ones.
10) I could be off about this one, but from my experience, powder laundry detergent comes in less plastic than liquid. Plus, let’s be honest, the liquid is a waste of water. Alternatively they make eco-friendly pods or sheets, but that can get pricey fast imo.
11) Buy your chapstick and deodorant in compostable packaging. Some companies like Old Spice and Dove are slowly implementing this, but also you can look to Etsy.
12) See if any products you use have a return program, either with Terracyle or on their own. The production of plastic is bad in and of itself however this is a good way to get rid of the packaging you already have or that other people have who won’t make the switch.
13) Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shave cream…all of it can be found in bar form. If you’re interested, I can send you the link to the shampoo bar I use, it’s super amazing.
14) If you get soft plastic bags for any reason (bread, shopping, toilet paper packaging, etc) you can return them to most stores and they’ll get recycled. Usually there’s a spot for them next to the trash and regular recycling. Target, Walmart, and Costco all do bag recycling for sure.
15) Turn off lights when you don’t need them
16) If you have the money, opt for bamboo toilet paper.
17) Bring your own takeout containers to restaurants instead of using their single-use plastic/styrofoam ones
18) Donate and sell your old items before just trashing them, if you really must get rid of them to begin with
19) Buy in bulk, it’s less plastic overall. For example, if you eat yogurt, buy the large 48oz tub instead of the individual servings.
20) A lot of local  recycling programs (in the USA) accept most plastics nowadays. I’m talking shampoo bottles, cleaning supply bottles, plastic coffee cups, yogurt containers, and anything else with a number of 1-7. I checked with my local recycling plant, check with yours before you trash the plastics you have. Once again, avoiding plastics to begin with is better, but if you have them at least try to recycle them.
21) Compost! Food in landfills don’t break down well and end up producing methane.
22) They make slightly more sustainable cotton swabs that really aren’t more expensive than the regular. I personally don’t favor the reusable silicone ones.
23) This one’s tiny and a given, but I’ll still say it—reusable straws.
24) Stop buying napkins and paper towels, use reusable napkins and rags instead
25) Also a given, but—reusable shopping bags are a must. /any bag that won’t break on you, you don’t have to go out and buy new things.
26) If you buy produce/veggies, buy them individually (instead of in prepackaged plastic) and use reusable mesh baggies.
27) Buy cleaning concentrates that mix with water in reusable bottles instead of buying pre-made stuff.
28) Make the switch to plant milk instead of dairy, or at least lower your consumption of dairy (Say you buy 1 gallon of milk a week, maybe switch to half a gallon regular milk and half a gallon plant milk).
29) If you have the time and energy, make your own snacks instead of buying prepackaged ones. For example, air pop your own popcorn kernals instead of buying microwave popcorn.
30) Buy jam/jelly in glass containers instead of plastic. Same goes for pasta sauce and, well, anything else that comes in a jar.
31) Bulk stores, if they happen to be near you, are your friend.
32) Borrow/rent instead of buying when you can, such as suits or dresses.

Biogas digester can give you some energy for cooking, activated biochar sequestration would give you better soil and some ""carbon currency"" in case you need a small (recyclable) lead acid battery for example.

Pro-EV,"Long post, but.....

It's all possible, but we live in a ***very*** complicated and connected environment.  Yes, we could replace ICE vehicles with electric, but that has plenty of downsides as well.  And capitalism isn't necessarily all bad.  It just needs serious guard rails.  It kind of boils down to ***awareness*** and ***priorities*** (global, not personal).  Here are some issues to consider:

* Fossil fuels have a much higher energy density than renewables, making it already an uphill climb if we are just going to replace ICE vehicles with electric.
* Externalities are a thing, and usually left to the consumer/society to deal with.  There is a huge landfill mound just north of Hartford, CT that was just a field 40 years ago.  Whoever made the stuff in it likely didn't pay for its disposal.  And, if I'm not mistaken, Germany has some kind of regulation where the manufacturer of refrigerators are required to take them back and the end of their life.  And many countries in the EU have minimum requirements for recyclable components.
* Scalability is a thing, too.  We need to understand the sheer scope of the task at hand.  Just in the US (assuming that my quick search of number of households that use fossil fuels directly for heat is correct at 40M), if we are to meet the goal of using heat pumps for these cases by 2050, we would need to manufacture almost 6,000 heat pumps every working day.  
* And last, but not least, on the hit list:  time.  Every day we delay a serious attempt at solving the issue(s) means we have a steeper hill to climb, and, at some point, the hill will become too steep.  (This is where capitalism fails, and in some ways inhibits progress.)  There are so many moving parts to the solutions that all developments need to be planned as you would a major construction effort (because it is).  Just in the US, 80M houses will need way more insulation than they have.  40M houses will need conversion to heat pumps or other alternative heat sources.  Charging stations will need to be planned and constructed to handle the new load.  The electric grid needs to be updated.  (In Vermont, they put a limit on grid tied solar panels because the grid couldn't handle it.)

And my last comment is this:  We really need to rethink HOW and WHY we do what we do.  Instead of just living like we always have and replacing things with like things, let's think about how we can do stuff differently and more sustainably.  Even if we replace ICE cars with electric, we're still throwing away about 300M tires per year.  How can we adjust our habits/processes so issues like this are no longer issues.  Again, just being aware of the moving pieces will help a lot.  

Do I think we (collectively) will get to this point in time?  Sadly, no.  We're aiming to keep the CO2 warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2050. Recent reporting from a number of sources indicate that we will blow past that in the next decade.   Will the earth survive?  Yup.  Will society as we know it survive?

Pro-EV,"TL;DR at the bottom  


Heres the thing about EVs compared to gas cars as far as a foot print goes. In the beginning a gas car will produce less overall emissions from when its metal in the earth to when it rolls of the assembly line compared to an EV equivalent since lithium-ion batteries are not easy or clean to manufacture at the moment. So day one of owning either, the gas car is cleaner.   


Say you drive either for two years/ 10,000 miles (based on you driving roughly half of the average, for those of you who drive the average of about 12,000 miles thats only one year), in some circumstances the gasoline car will have produced slightly less overall footprint than the comparable gasoline car (it is heavily dependent on energy production and the car itself), but by year 3 or 4 (2/3 if you drive 12k\~ miles) the EV will almost always become cleaner than the gasoline car, because its environmental efficiency adds up in the fact it isn't directly burning fuel when driven compared to gas cars. That manufacturing footprint wont go away, but by now it is beating out the cost that would be incurred of driving a gas car is now more than the EVs foot print.   


To tie into your car, hybrids are still very clean. While an older Prius may not stack up as well compared to a newer hybrid or EV as the battery has aged, it's still a relatively green car. Even considering a new hybrid is worth the look as much as the EV, since many new plug-in hybrids (especially if you have short drive times) will run on battery power most of the time anyway, meaning that the reduction of emissions is still there almost as much as an EV.   


At the end in my opinion the question is how much do you need a new car. if you dont need one why waste money, but if you do need (or really want) a new car and have the money, both EVs and Hybrids are worth the look. There are also other alternative fuels (diesel, bio diesel, propane, hydrogen, E86, etc, which all have ups and downs), and i think most of these are worth considering.   


While the footprint of manufacturing an EV will likely be bigger than it will say 5 years from now, driving a gas car for 5 years will have a bigger footprint than the manufacturing cost to the environment since they produce larger yearly emissions (one source i found while writing the paper this is based on put gas sedans at about 5.2 tons of CO2 per year and a comparable EV at 2 tons per year. Manufacturing is much different, it can range so far so it is hard to calculate).   


My personal opinion: If you are set on replacing your car, looking at new or used hybrids and EVs are both good options, but if you cant find something that works, an efficient gasoline is not the end of the world. Well, at least just one of them wont be.   
TL;DR : In the long run, an EV would be cleaner than buying and driving a gas car now and waiting for the overall footprint of EV manufacturing to reduce itself. Another great option is (plug in) hybrids, as they tend to have a good middle ground and in many cases will function like an EV since the battery has enough power to get most places.",tldr bottom compared gas far foot print go beginning gas produce less overall emission metal earth roll assembly line compared equivalent since lithiumion easy clean manufacture moment day owning either gas cleaner say drive either two mile based driving roughly half average drive average mile circumstance gasoline produced slightly less overall footprint comparable gasoline heavily dependent production drive k mile almost always become cleaner gasoline environmental efficiency add fact directly burning fuel driven compared gas manufacturing footprint go away beating cost incurred driving gas foot print tie hybrid still clean older prius may stack well compared newer hybrid aged still relatively green even considering hybrid worth look much since many plugin hybrid especially short drive time run power time anyway meaning reduction emission still almost much end opinion question much waste money really want money hybrid worth look alternative fuel diesel bio diesel propane hydrogen e etc ups down think worth considering footprint manufacturing likely bigger say driving gas bigger footprint manufacturing cost environment since produce larger yearly emission source found writing paper based put gas sedan ton co per comparable ton per manufacturing much different range far hard calculate personal opinion set replacing looking used hybrid good option find something work efficient gasoline end world well least tldr long run cleaner buying driving gas waiting overall footprint manufacturing reduce another great option plug hybrid tend good middle ground many case function since enough power place,236

Pro-EV,"Economic benefits include the jobs supported by the entire domestic production line, from auto glass to chassis to assembly. 

Environmental benefits include significantly reduced smog in cities, given the low fuel economy and ancient design of the current fleet.

As a side benefit, any large production orders tend to drive down cost across the board, so consumer e-vehicles will become cheaper as well.

Centralized power generation at a coal plant (for example) is much more efficient and cleaner than a hundred thousand internal combustion engines.

We just need to replace the new cars (ones that would be produced anyways) with electric vehicles.

As for the power sector emissions, Elon Musk has made the argument that an electric vehicle would be less polluting than a gasoline car even if that electric vehicle was powered with 100% coal power, because a power plant is so much more energy efficient than an internal combustion engine. Regardless of whether or not this is actually true, you have to realize that you're pretty much guaranteed to not be using 100% coal power in the first place. It depends on where you live, but the electricity grid is probably at least bit greener (or maybe even a lot greener) than this, and so I think it is definitely safe to assume that an electric vehicle is significantly less polluting than a gasoline car.

Pro-EV,"For the record, Gore's philosophy is to ""tax what we burn, not what we earn."" That's to say, raise taxes on carbon, and lower taxes on income.

To illustrate the idea that Gore's idea is *obviously* the best, let me prove that a well designed carbon tax could reduce deadweight loss, help the environment, *and* increase revenue, all at the same time.

It's hard to explain why without visualizing it. [Here's a graph I whipped up,](http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/2816/carbontax.png) and the rest of my post will be based on it. In order to understand this graph, you need to have a good grasp of microeconomics and basic calculus. It would help you visualize my logic if have a grasp of multivariable calc but I guess you could read this without it.

Anyway, referring to the graph, the point ""Zero Deadweight Loss"" would be the perfect policy position in light of revenue not mattering. Except, we need more revenue than a simple carbon tax can provide. So the navy blue line that crosses over that point are the most efficient points for the amount of revenue they provide. The truth is, in order for government to produce enough revenue, we'll have to have some deadweight loss in the process. And you can actually lower deadweight loss by *over-taxing* carbon and lowering taxes on labor further. The reason why is simple: if we keep the deadweight loss of carbon taxes at 0, if there is a tax on labor, then the marginal deadweight loss of carbon taxes will be lower than the marginal deadweight loss of labor taxes. Hence, carbon taxes should ideally create some deadweight loss!

One might ask, ""well doesn't a tax on carbon also act as a tax on labor? In which case you might expect the loci where D'(r) is equal to slope the opposite way.

Except, that's not the case. The effects of carbon tax on labor aren't substantial; both the empirical data and theory support this fact. See Larry Goulder's *Environmental Taxation and the Double Dividend: A Reader's Guide* for more information. Actually, that's the paper I'm basing my model on, for the curious.

So you probably have two more questions: first, why did I draw the red curve? I drew it to illustrate the point that a well designed carbon tax can both increase revenue and decrease deadweight loss. Take any point that's above the Equal Revenue Curve and below the red curve. It'll both increase revenue and decrease deadweight loss.

The last question you might have is: what does any of this have to do with equity? Well, if government can improve the market and get more revenue, too, not only can the government spend more on researching energy alternatives (as the article proposes), but we can also afford to significantly increase funding for programs that help the poor like the Earned Income Tax Credit.*

All that... *AND* while improving economic efficiency *AND* helping the environment?! Wow. It's almost like a carbon tax is a no-brainer!

Pro-EV,"All these renewable technologies should be considered separately.  Biofuel is a well known bad idea as far a I know.

Solar doesn't actually require lithium at all.  We don't even need to worry about storing the energy, there's enough demand in the daytime, especially when you start replacing direct gas fire heating.

There are new versions in development that don't need silver either.  We can also extract magnesium from seawater using electricity, and use it as fuel in fuel cells, the waste from which could theoretically be made totally non toxic and able to just be dumped back down the toilet and return to whence it came. There are already cars that run on aluminum fuel.

Wind is also, as far as I can tell, better than fossil.

There is no replacement for reducing consumption. We are indeed, addicted to wasting energy.

And I thank you for bringing the palm oil issue to light, as palm oil is such a big problem.


And if you think the big tech community is causing all this pollution... Look at Bitcoin, and you'll probably find evidence you are in fact right.   But tech seems to have two opposing philosophies.  Large scale, heavy, high power, manually controlled, and for the purpose of increasing production,  and true high tech, which is tiny silicon chips, controlled by code, reducing material use, etc.

Every since Apple started their campaign, (and for other reasons) big tech has had an element of ""old fashioned is better"".  

We're told about the IoT revolution, but programmers hate IoT, and try to put as much old school analog simplicity in their designs as they can.  Even the idea of replacing phones every few years feels more industrial than truly technological.   Industry says ""Keep the wheels turning, make more phones, make more jobs, more GDP"".

Linky http://gigaom.com/cleantech/today-in-green-it-the-fossil-fuel-subsidy-game/

At midnight on New Year’s Day the Department of the Treasury’s Section 1603 cash grants program expired, dashing the hopes of those who have expressed legitimate concern that the end of various grants and tax credits will further devastate the embattled solar industry.

The program was a subsidy in its purest form: The government paid businesses to build renewable energy projects — a cash grant equivalent to 30 percent of the cost of each project — which lowered the ultimate cost of the produced power in the market. There were no complex tax credits, nor was there any complicated rewriting of accounting rules so that a company could be subsidized through lower corporate taxes. And there were no preferential trade laws to protect an industry. Companies needed only to build a project and the government would pick up 30 percent of the tab.

With this in mind, I took some time over the holidays to sit down with the monstrous, 351-page report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) titled “Inventory of estimated budgetary support and tax expenditures for fossil fuels.” I wanted to answer the question, How is it that the political winds are beating against renewable energy when fossil fuels have been supported for almost a century — and their support is actually growing year to year — and yet nobody blinks an eye?

Some may recall that the report got some press when it was released in October, mainly because it reported that in 2010 global subsidies intended to reduce the price of fossil fuels amounted to $409 billion. That was $110 billion more than 2009, and there are projections that fossil fuel subsidies will go to $660 billion by 2020. Just to put that in perspective, $409 billion is just under 20 percent of the total tax revenue in the U.S. — roughly equivalent to the market value of Exxon-Mobil, the largest publicly traded company in the world.

Right about now is when most people start to scratch their heads, thinking about federal and state gasoline taxes in the U.S. and the fact that Europeans pay $8 to $10 a gallon for gas because of even harsher taxes. Isn’t the government taxing oil, not subsidizing it?

The answer lies in the fact that when an industry has been subsidized for almost a century, as is the case with the fossil fuel industry, the ways in which those companies are supported get numerous and complex. The OECD’s report counted at least 250 mechanisms. Unlike the 1603 Program of the Department of the Treasury, most subsidies are far more opaque.

Let’s take a look at a few. Be forewarned this can get esoteric, complicated and, yeah, boring. But since everyone loves to talk about gasoline, let’s start there, and with the U.S.

As part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the “Temporary Expensing of Equipment for Refining” was introduced. It is a tax provision that allows crude oil refiners to expense 50 percent of qualified property used for processing liquid fuel. Normally refiners would have to depreciate the equipment over its lifetime, often a decade or more, but now they get to expense half up front, effectively lowering their taxes. No big deal, right? Well, it cost the U.S. government $760 million in 2010 and has exceeded $2 billion overall since 2005.

How about Germany, which has been a global leader in renewable energy, with 9 percent of its energy coming from renewables? Like many countries, the cost of importing coal is lower than producing coal from hard coal mines in Germany. But RAG Deutsche Steinkohle continues to mine hard coal, making up the price difference with 1.7 billion euros in direct subsidies in 2010, down from almost 5 billion euros in 2000, as Germany has finally decided upon a slow phase out of coal subsidies by 2018.

The list of countries subsidizing fossil fuels and the methods they employ goes on and on (the OECD report looked at 24 countries), but the impact is that we never know the true cost of power and fuel, energy demand grows unchecked because the market is manipulated by subsidies, and investment in alternative energy is discouraged.

More renewable energy subsidies in the U.S. will come up for review this year, like the production tax credit (PTC), and my guess is that they will face a tough road. But before another screed about handouts for the alternative energy gets penned, authors and policy makers should stop to consider a global subsidy system for fossil fuels that has evolved over the past 100 years and how alternative energy has to compete on that uneven playing field.",without subscription gigaom pro linky midnight day department treasury section cash grant program expired dashing hope expressed legitimate concern end various grant tax credit devastate embattled solar industry program subsidy purest form government paid business build renewable project cash grant equivalent percent cost project lowered ultimate cost produced power market complex tax credit complicated rewriting accounting rule could subsidized lower corporate tax preferential trade law protect industry needed build project government pick percent tab mind took time holiday sit monstrous page report international agency iea organisation economic cooperation development oecd titled inventory estimated budgetary support tax expenditure fossil fuel wanted answer question political wind beating renewable fossil fuel supported almost century support actually growing yet nobody blink eye may recall report got press released october mainly reported global subsidy intended reduce price fossil fuel amounted billion billion projection fossil fuel subsidy go billion put perspective billion percent total tax revenue yous roughly equivalent market value exxonmobil largest publicly traded world right start scratch head thinking federal state gasoline tax yous fact european pay gallon gas even harsher tax government taxing oil subsidizing answer lie fact industry subsidized almost century case fossil fuel industry way supported numerous complex oecds report counted least mechanism unlike program department treasury subsidy far opaque let u take look forewarned esoteric complicated yeah boring since everyone love talk gasoline let u start yous part policy act temporary expensing equipment refining introduced tax provision allows crude oil refiner expense percent qualified property used processing liquid fuel normally refiner depreciate equipment lifetime often decade expense half front effectively lowering tax big deal right well cost yous government million exceeded billion overall since germany global leader renewable percent coming renewables many country cost importing coal lower producing coal hard coal mine germany rag deutsche steinkohle continues mine hard coal making price difference billion euro direct subsidy almost billion euro germany finally decided upon slow phase coal subsidy list country subsidizing fossil fuel method employ go oecd report looked country impact never know true cost power fuel demand grows unchecked market manipulated subsidy investment alternative discouraged renewable subsidy yous come review production tax credit ptc guess face tough road another screed handout alternative penned author policy maker stop consider global subsidy system fossil fuel evolved past alternative compete uneven playing field,381

Will you stick to the same side of your bullshit story, please?  

>For example, cutting a ton of CO2 with on-shore wind turbines in Germany probably costs about $35,  

Let's see now, a ton of CO2 is produced for every 1750 kWh.  
A 5MW turbine @20% x 365 x 24 = 8760 MWh / 1.75 MWh = 5005 ton's of CO2/year **not** coming out of your dino-fuel (and the profit not going into your pockets).

Pro-EV,"> If Canadian oil is not used, the oil will be extracted elsewhere in the world, also with environmental costs. If we do it at home, in a country with high standards and lower corruption than most other countries, we have a much better chance of doing this cleanly. 

I think the problem with this is that demand for fossil fuel is not modulated by supply as much as other goods are. So when China needs to fuel another 40 million cars they'll be buying tar sands oil *and* more Saudi oil. OPEC will not suddenly stop producing when Alberta starts really pumping; we'll still have the problem of ""economically empowering fanatical militants overseas"" with the added detriment of also now burning dirtier fuel.

Tar sands extraction is also measurably more damaging than the pumping we do in say, West Texas. It needs to be dug up as opposed to drilled out, clear-cutting and potentially wrecking the area you dig it out of. We also need to expend more energy to get it out of the ground, up to a fifth more.

Solar doesn't actually require lithium at all.  We don't even need to worry about storing the energy, there's enough demand in the daytime, especially when you start replacing direct gas fire heating.

There are new versions in development that don't need silver either.  We can also extract magnesium from seawater using electricity, and use it as fuel in fuel cells, the waste from which could theoretically be made totally non toxic and able to just be dumped back down the toilet and return to whence it came. There are already cars that run on aluminum fuel.

Wind is also, as far as I can tell, better than fossil.

There is no replacement for reducing consumption. We are indeed, addicted to wasting energy.

And if you think the big tech community is causing all this pollution... Look at Bitcoin, and you'll probably find evidence you are in fact right.   But tech seems to have two opposing philosophies.

Every since Apple started their campaign, (and for other reasons) big tech has had an element of ""old fashioned is better"".  

We're told about the IoT revolution, but programmers hate IoT, and try to put as much old school analog simplicity in their designs as they can.

So OK, how about raw greenhouse gasses.  Primarily, that is an issue of feedlot beef, not all meat.  It is an issue because the cows are not eating their natural diet, and because, according to the study linked, of the massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizers used to grow the corn fed to cows.  

No argument.  I absolutely think that sort of agriculture should end. Feedlot beef is the product of grain subsidies that made growing corn at a loss profitable.

From the study:

>The use of nitrogen fertilizers in feed and manure
production contributes 75–80% of annual agricultural emissions of
N2O, equivalent to 2,200,000,000 tons of CO2. Some data suggest that N2O is the largest livestock-driven climate change threat, primarily resulting from the production of manure and the intensive over-use of fertilizers for the production of animal feed (Idel, 2013). 

>Indeed the amount of nitrogen released by livestock via manure is estimated to exceed the global use of nitrogen fertilizers.

The modern CAFO model of raising beef cattle is a product of cheap oil and subsidized corn.  Get cows back on grass, eating the perennial grasses that grow without seeding or fertilizing, and allow their excrement to strengthen and build the soil, all of which will sequester carbon.

Pro-EV,"Today, more than 70 carbon pricing schemes have been implemented around the globe, but their contributions to emissions reductions remains a subject of heated debate in science and policy. Here we assess the effectiveness of carbon pricing in reducing emissions using a rigorous, machine-learning assisted systematic review and meta-analysis. Based on 483 effect sizes extracted from 80 causal ex-post evaluations across 21 carbon pricing schemes, we find that introducing a carbon price has yielded immediate and substantial emission reductions for at least 17 of these policies, despite the low level of prices in most instances. Statistically significant emissions reductions range between –5% to –21% across the schemes (–4% to –15% after correcting for publication bias). Our study highlights critical evidence gaps with regard to dozens of unevaluated carbon pricing schemes and the price elasticity of emissions reductions. More rigorous synthesis of carbon pricing and other climate policies is required across a range of outcomes to advance our understanding of “what works” and accelerate learning on climate solutions in science and policy.",today carbon pricing scheme implemented around globe contribution emission reduction remains subject heated debate science policy assess effectiveness carbon pricing reducing emission using rigorous machinelearning assisted systematic review metaanalysis based effect size extracted causal expost evaluation across carbon pricing scheme find introducing carbon price yielded immediate substantial emission reduction least policy despite low level price instance statistically significant emission reduction range across scheme correcting publication bias study highlight critical evidence gap regard dozen unevaluated carbon pricing scheme price elasticity emission reduction rigorous synthesis carbon pricing climate policy required across range outcome advance understanding work accelerate learning climate solution science policy,100

Pro-EV,"""Underground thermal energy networks"" sounds great and futuristic if you're into that. But the everyday way of saying the same thing is ""[district heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating)"". It describes any centralized plan where instead of each apartment in a city needing to have its own furnace, you create a city-wide grid to pipe hot water from a centralized source, so that buildings can use that hot water to keep the buildings warm.

It's just an electric grid or a city water system, but for heating.

It is true that fossil fuel is often used in these plants today. However, even when they are, this is one of the most efficient, lowest-carbon uses of fossil fuels, one of the best of the bad. Moreover, any non-fossil heat source can be used instead, including:

* Waste heat from factories.
* Waste heat from nuclear power stations.
* Geothermal heating or geothermal heat pumps.
* Centralized solar heating.

Local resource availability determines the best choice.

The big new difference that the article mentions, is that you can also run cool water through the exact same system in summer instead, to cool buildings efficiently.

The advantage of large, centralized networks, is that they are more stable, and therefore more predictable. Predictability is good for grids because it makes it more possible for providers to meet demand.",underground thermal network sound great futuristic everyday way saying district heating describes centralized plan instead apartment city needing furnace create citywide grid pipe hot water centralized source building use hot water keep building warm grid city water system heating true fossil fuel often used plant today however even efficient lowestcarbon us fossil fuel best bad moreover nonfossil heat source used instead including waste heat factory waste heat nuclear power geothermal heating geothermal heat pump centralized solar heating local resource availability determines best choice big difference article mention run cool water exact system summer instead cool building efficiently advantage large centralized network stable therefore predictable predictability good grid possible provider meet demand,111

I'm interested in how they address the challenge of not having enough viable, arable land in the US to produce enough veggies to make the switch, or, if bread and grains are increased in consumption to compensate. I remember doing the calculations in my sustainable vegetable production class. It's heartbreaking.

Edit (update): Thanks to redditor u/qrtsawnoak for providing a link to the article.  rdcu.be/cEHPZ   

The article suggests that if the US, France, Australia, and Germany stopped animal agriculture production, and, that if the land previously used was to go back to it's natural state, we would see the significant carbon change. 

I agree with the sentiment of this article. We need more plant focused diets in first world countries. We should be limiting our animal agriculture practices if we cannot find a way to limit their impact to reasonable thresholds. I also agree with their math. If the world changed as they recommend, I believe it would have the positive impact they claim. However, I begin to disagree with the idea that their solution is manageable. 

What we know for certain is that this is not a viable solution. There is no such business that will volunteer to stop it's profitable production AND give up their greatest asset: land. And to make this even more difficult, to not use the land for housing, farming, or any other necessary human occupation. This solution dials up even more challenges while only addressing (not solving) one challenge. 

Before you downpour on the downvote, the environment needs to be a more important issue than it is currently being treated for. Serious action must be taken.

Solar doesn't actually require lithium at all.  We don't even need to worry about storing the energy, there's enough demand in the daytime, especially when you start replacing direct gas fire heating.

There are new versions in development that don't need silver either.  We can also extract magnesium from seawater using electricity, and use it as fuel in fuel cells, the waste from which could theoretically be made totally non toxic and able to just be dumped back down the toilet and return to whence it came. There are already cars that run on aluminum fuel.

Wind is also, as far as I can tell, better than fossil.

There is no replacement for reducing consumption. We are indeed, addicted to wasting energy.

And if you think the big tech community is causing all this pollution... Look at Bitcoin, and you'll probably find evidence you are in fact right.   But tech seems to have two opposing philosophies.  Large scale, heavy, high power, manually controlled, and for the purpose of increasing production,  and true high tech, which is tiny silicon chips, controlled by code, reducing material use, etc.

Every since Apple started their campaign, (and for other reasons) big tech has had an element of ""old fashioned is better"".  

We're told about the IoT revolution, but programmers hate IoT, and try to put as much old school analog simplicity in their designs as they can.  Even the idea of replacing phones every few years feels more industrial than truly technological.   Industry says ""Keep the wheels turning, make more phones, make more jobs, more GDP"".

It wants a constant flow, a constant state of trial and error, and a lack of any attempt to control or predict anything, and it doesn't want to just jump straight to the new tech, it wants to ""feel it's way there"" with experiments. This uses a lot of resources, because there's just more products being made, that are physically bigger.  Read Antifragile for the real perspective on that viewpoint.

But high tech, when properly done  says ""Make it solid state and last 25 years, as small as possible, pack in every feature you can, make it work anywhere, spend 10 billion dollars on development, computer simulate everything, and accept no compromises, spare no expense, and if nobody can afford it, keep making it till it's cheap by pure scale"".

Pro-EV,"I'm going to discuss your ideas a bit and maybe you can take a step back and stop thinking in panic mode.

>But how far are you willing to go to preserve this planet? 

First off, it is not about preserving the planet. It is about keeping the climate within the bounds of sustainability for something that at least vaguely resembles our current cultural patterns because humans have been mining and burning hydrocarbons that have been locked under the crust for millions of years.

>Would you go to war against a foreign power to reduce carbon emissions? 

Modern war is the exact opposite of carbon neutral. War is the most wasteful thing that humans do in every respect. This is literally the absolute opposite of what the world needs more of if you want to reduce carbon emissions.

>Are you be willing to live in a grass hut and wear a loin cloth the rest of your life to reduce your carbon footprint?

You are thinking in black and white panic mode here and drawing a false dichotomy between your fantasy of some kind of desolate primitivism and an unstated, but opposite fantasy of the most excessive modern life. It does not take drastic measures to alter your footprint. What can you do personally? Eat less meat. You don't need to be a strict vegan, either. Moderation! Ride a bike instead of driving a car as much as possible. Be the trim tab. You need to be a realistic example that  normal people can emulate so that you can change the culture around you toward sustainability, not a prickly zealot. That only serves to drive others away.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim_tab#Trim_tab_as_a_metaphor

>Implement a eugenics program to combat overpopulation?

No. The world is not overpopulated. Do you really want to promote the creation of an EnviroGestapo?

>Would it be worth shutting down air travel until there is a sustainable alternative?

Air travel is about as efficient per person per mile when compared to rail. I don't know where you get the idea that air travel is inefficient. Also jet fuel can and will be easily transferred to biofuel as we transition to a carbon neutral economy. Cars are the problem. Taxis are the absolute worst. Just ride a goddamn bike!

Pro-EV,"The idea that GW might ""solve itself"" is wildly optimistic. A better question is whether GW is even solvable at all (not so much technically as pragmatically.)

The points you bring up about the proliferation of EVs and residential solar are certainly promising, for a number of reasons (I have 2 EVs and solar myself), but we're deluding ourselves if we think this trend will do anything to stop GW. Even under the most optimistic projections it'll be a couple decades before such a paradigm is widespread enough to have much of an impact, while according to some reports we might *already* be past the point of no return for GW.

It's probably time to start focusing more on trying to find ways to actively reverse climate change and/or mitigate its effects than on just trying to limit CO2 emissions.

23% of the world's energy comes from renewable sources. Mostly hydro and they estimate 31% by 2040 but if the capitalists and the republicans in the US get out of the way of progress we could easily get to 50% in that time by converting the US energy grid to one that is is 85-100% renewable

Pro-EV,"For some reason reddit is deleting the spaces between paragraphs. It's pretty hard to read in its current format so here's a shorter version:

The coal industry lost 50,000 jobs from 2008-2012. In that same period solar and wind power added 80,000 jobs. Wind and solar power are also getting far cheaper and more commercially viable than they used be. In 1977 the cost of solar was $76.67 per watt. In 2014 it costs a mere $0.49 per watt. That's an insane price reduction that consistently decreases every year. Even if no government action is taken to run the United States on renewable energy it’s clear to see how solar and wind power may just outcompete fossil fuel regardless. In another amazing example the relatively newly formed electric car (and now solar panel) company “Tesla” generated more money last quarter than the entire oil industry in the United States, who lost 67 billion dollars that same year.
	Taxing renewable energy sources, investing in fossil fuels, and deregulating businesses is a step backwards for America. Fossil fuels are a limited resource that will run dry, it doesn’t make sense to try and revive these industries. Imagine if all the near deserted oil fields in Texas and North Dakota were made into solar or wind farms. Imagine if solar panels or solar tiles were installed in the majority of homes in the United States, currently less than 1% of homes utilize solar power. There’s hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created in the renewable energy sector and hundreds of thousands of Americans that could reinvigorate the economy. Protecting the environment does not have to equal a loss of jobs, in fact just the opposite. The economy and the environment are entirely capable of growing side by side. Investing in the future of America and its pristine wilderness is among the best ways to make America great again.

Pro-EV,"All these renewable technologies should be considered separately.  Biofuel is a well known bad idea as far a I know.

Solar doesn't actually require lithium at all.  We don't even need to worry about storing the energy, there's enough demand in the daytime, especially when you start replacing direct gas fire heating.

There are new versions in development that don't need silver either.  We can also extract magnesium from seawater using electricity, and use it as fuel in fuel cells, the waste from which could theoretically be made totally non toxic and able to just be dumped back down the toilet and return to whence it came. There are already cars that run on aluminum fuel.

Wind is also, as far as I can tell, better than fossil.

There is no replacement for reducing consumption. We are indeed, addicted to wasting energy.

And I thank you for bringing the palm oil issue to light, as palm oil is such a big problem.


And if you think the big tech community is causing all this pollution... Look at Bitcoin, and you'll probably find evidence you are in fact right.   But tech seems to have two opposing philosophies.  Large scale, heavy, high power, manually controlled, and for the purpose of increasing production,  and true high tech, which is tiny silicon chips, controlled by code, reducing material use, etc.

Every since Apple started their campaign, (and for other reasons) big tech has had an element of ""old fashioned is better"".  

We're told about the IoT revolution, but programmers hate IoT, and try to put as much old school analog simplicity in their designs as they can.  Even the idea of replacing phones every few years feels more industrial than truly technological.   Industry says ""Keep the wheels turning, make more phones, make more jobs, more GDP"".

It wants a constant flow, a constant state of trial and error, and a lack of any attempt to control or predict anything, and it doesn't want to just jump straight to the new tech, it wants to ""feel it's way there"" with experiments. This uses a lot of resources, because there's just more products being made, that are physically bigger.  Read Antifragile for the real perspective on that viewpoint.

But high tech, when properly done  says ""Make it solid state and last 25 years, as small as possible, pack in every feature you can, make it work anywhere, spend 10 billion dollars on development, computer simulate everything, and accept no compromises, spare no expense, and if nobody can afford it, keep making it till it's cheap by pure scale"".

Pro-EV,"I was actually skimming this article yesterday and commented on the /r/RenewableEnergy sub. Didn't knew who the guy was, but that actually explains somethings.. 


Comment mildly edited below..

------


Not using anything else than 4h batteries seems to have been more of an input decision  than an output.

>	In sum, batteries with longer than 4-h storage are not needed tokeep the grid stable. We similarlyfind that batteries with 1.94-h storage can keep the grids stable in all the regions (results notshown). However, for some regions, it is more efficient to havebatteries with storage times at peak discharge of up to 62 h.Table S14, Column (e), shows the ratio of the assumed storage apacity (TWh) to the modeled maximum battery discharge rate(TW) during each simulation. This ratio is the ideal number of hoursof storage at the peak discharge rate. **The ratio ranges from 4 h forWECC to 62 h for NEWY, with most values below 25 h.** 

And this was already on top of adding non existing 60gw of pumped storage. And cold and hot storage and other hydro and hydrogen. The hot and cold storage didn't dive in but seems interesting. Not familiar with it/understand what they mean in large numbers.

>The ratioindicates that, although 4-h batteries workfine, they result in, forall cases aside from WECC, peak discharge rates higher thannecessary for the simulations performed. Thus, a longer storagetime would ensure that the peak discharge rate of batteries is closerto what is needed. **However, there is no technical disadvantage ofhaving a higher peak discharge rate than necessary. Instead, there isan advantage since it allows for moreflexibility to meet futuregrowth in peak load**

Except cost...🙄 obviously more MW is better than less. Doesn't mean it will be the lower cost /better economics though. Adding more charge/discharge power to a storage unit is different from adding more storage  volume. Typically  adding two 2MW 2hr batteries is not cheaper than adding a 2MW 4hr battery. (This depends on volumes and actual costs, but rough rule of thumb)

Skimmed through the article and annex on my phone but couldn't find the storage costs except on an LCOE approach? If that's the case, that would explain that weird quote above. It seems a really big mistake to do though.

Pro-EV,"A couple of issues that generally come up in these discussions. First, does a carbon tax distort markets? I believe it actually does the opposite by offsetting a market-distorting negative externality. From wikipedia:

>In economic theory, pollution is considered a [negative externality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_externality), a negative effect on a third party not directly involved in a transaction, and is a type of [market failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure). To confront parties with the issue, the economist [Arthur Pigou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Pigou) proposed taxing the goods (in this case hydrocarbon fuels), which were the source of the negative externality (carbon dioxide) so as to accurately reflect the cost of the goods' production to society, thereby internalizing the costs associated with the goods' production. A tax on a negative externality is called a [Pigovian tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax), and should equal the [marginal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost) damage costs.

Think of how much further ahead clean energy would be today if fossil fuels had been paying their true cost to society all along.

The second common criticism of carbon taxes are that they are regressive. Well that is definitely the case for a straight carbon tax. But a revenue-neutral fee/dividend approach actually makes it quite progressive, which will also likely have the positive side effect of stimulating consumer spending and economic growth. This approach is endorsed by Citizens Climate Lobby and a bipartisan group of politicians in the US.",couple issue generally come discussion first carbon tax distort market believe actually opposite offsetting marketdistorting negative externality wikipedia economic theory pollution considered negative externality negative effect third party directly involved transaction type market failure confront party issue economist arthur pigou proposed taxing good case hydrocarbon fuel source negative externality carbon dioxide accurately reflect cost good production society thereby internalizing cost associated good production tax negative externality called pigovian tax equal marginal damage cost think much ahead clean today fossil fuel paying true cost society along second common criticism carbon tax regressive well definitely case straight carbon tax revenueneutral feedividend approach actually quite progressive likely positive side effect stimulating consumer spending economic growth approach endorsed citizen climate lobby bipartisan group politician u,121

- Hydrogen DRI with an electric arc furnace is cheaper than coal with a blast oxygen furnace when electricity is below $30/MWh, which is possible with renewables.
- Cement production is harder because the conversion of limestone to calcium oxide releases CO2 (the heat is the easy bit to solve).
- The Swedes are using carbon capture for cement production because their high carbon price justifies it.

Pro-EV,"Strong agree here. The article focuses on potential impacts to the transmission and distribution networks, which is absolutely a huge concern. More intense storms are definitely bad news for overhead lines. There's also impacts to generators too - once through cooling facilities are going to be limited when days start getting hotter.  Nuke plants especially are at risk of being turned off because the water body they use to dump heat into can't take it. Hotter ocean temperatures are leading to jellyfish booms, which can clog cooling water intakes. We haven't seen much of that in North America yet, but heat related shutdowns for nukes has been a problem in Europe for a few years now. That plus, major storms are still major storms.  Precautionary shutdowns if the powerplant is in a hurricane landfall region still happens, as it should.

Hydro of course is reliant on weather.  The prolonged drought years in the west can certainly impact the amount of water resource available for power generation.  Wind turbines too are susceptible to storm conditions.  They cut out at certain wind speeds and feather the blades to minimize loading on the rotors - but strong enough winds can cause serious damage even beyond forced shutdowns.  Lightning strikes can also be an issue, these WTGs stand pretty tall.  They are always equipped with some very serious lightning protection as a result, but everything has its capacity and if lightning becomes a lot more intense, this could be a problem.

Even solar is susceptible.  Lightning can and does strike solar farms.  Mounting systems are designed for some level of maximum dynamic loading. Extreme weather events can expose these systems to conditions beyond their design criteria.

Resilience is more than just high levels of reliability. Sometimes things will fail - and recovering from that failure is a huge part of resilience. Extreme weather conditions are transient (and if they aren't then we have much bigger problems to deal with) - so getting back to ""normal"" is a key issue.  Distributed energy resources helps with that.  First, loss of generators isn't all or nothing. If a big central generator gets hit - you lose all of it.  If a big wind farm gets hit, some WTGs may well survive and be available to produce power during the reconstruction period. Second, restarting smaller systems is easier than restarting big ones. Thirdly, DERs are distributed.  It's more likely that you'll have some generators nearby than having a big central plant.  So if the transmission network is at serious risk, getting smaller islands up and running provides a base to rebuild from.",strong agree article focus potential impact transmission distribution network absolutely huge concern intense storm definitely bad news overhead line impact generator cooling facility going limited day start getting hotter nuke plant especially risk turned water body use dump heat take hotter ocean temperature leading jellyfish boom clog cooling water intake seen much north america yet heat related shutdown nuke problem europe plus major storm still major storm precautionary shutdown powerplant hurricane landfall region still happens hydro course reliant weather prolonged drought west certainly impact amount water resource available power generation wind turbine susceptible storm condition cut certain wind speed feather blade minimize loading rotor strong enough wind cause serious damage even beyond forced shutdown lightning strike issue wtgs stand pretty tall always equipped serious lightning protection result everything capacity lightning becomes lot intense could problem even solar susceptible lightning strike solar farm mounting system designed level maximum dynamic loading extreme weather event expose system condition beyond design criterion resilience high level reliability sometimes fail recovering failure huge part resilience extreme weather condition transient much bigger problem deal getting back normal key issue distributed resource help first loss generator nothing big central generator hit lose big wind farm hit wtgs may well survive available produce power reconstruction period second restarting smaller system easier restarting big thirdly ders distributed likely generator nearby big central plant transmission network serious risk getting smaller island running provides base rebuild,234

Pro-EV,"Go to fueleconomy.gov, and there you can see what the GHG emissions are for a variety of different cars. When looking at the emissions, make sure you select tailpipe AND upstream emissions for a fair comparison.

Pro-EV,"I don't know if there's a niche for some-sort-of-nuclear baseload, but I can try to make the case that it's not inherently ridiculous. Short version is ""covering 50% of power with sustainable + storage is easy, covering 99% is very, very hard.""

I divide [grid electricity] storage into four categories from easiest-to-make-money to hardest. ""Typical day duck curve"", ""typical day overnight"", ""atypical day/week/month"" and ""seasonal"". 

For a typical day, it relatively easy and cheap to replace fossil fuel with sustainable + storage over the [duck curve](https://www.caiso.com/Documents/FlexibleResourcesHelpRenewables_FastFacts.pdf) . You need very roughly 5% of a full day's usage, a little over an hour. [""relatively"" is an important phrase; that's ~500 GWh of storage.] You get to use that almost every day, and depending on how the duck curve looks you might get to use it twice a day (morning and evening). 

On a typical day, you can also loadshift some solar [or wind] and cover the nighttime hours. That takes a lot more storage - maybe ""eight average hours"" or ~3500 GWh for the US- but you still get to use it on all the typical days. So 300 cycles a year, maybe. You can still make money on that. 

Now we're in the Pareto problem area - the 20% of the problem that costs 80% of the money. One part of this is a cold, cloudy, low-wind week. Or three. It's not really ""emergency"" because it happens a couple times a year and it's not really a surprise, but you need something that can handle full load, possibly for hundreds of hours. ""Atypical conditions"" isn't a great phrase but it's the best I could come up with. 

The other is seasonal - for instance, winter might have 20% less solar than spring and 20% more demand. This is a terrible match for storage because it's one or two cycles a YEAR at two thousand hours per cycle. 

There are a number of possible solutions to high-power,long-duration cases and nuclear may have a niche there.

The ""for an SUV"" is the key bit.  The most cramped minivan is a lot more spacious than the largest SUV.

Kia is offering lease deals that are really hard to ignore.  Especially in light of the greed being demonstrated by some of the VW dealers.

Against-EV,">Electric batteries require mining lithium, cobalt and other metals that have devastating environmental impacts

Newer battery technologies use little to no cobalt. Lithium isn't really ""mined"" it is extracted from heavy brine sources but that just means evaporating off the excess water. Mining other resources are not more damaging or impactful than oil drilling and refinement. 

>use child labour (I think we'll need to increase this mining upwards of 6 times if we all start using EV's)

New mining is primarily in countries or regions that have strong child labor laws. As mentioned above, cobalt mining is being less important for battery production and most, if not all, car manufacturers are changing to source raw materials outside of areas like central Africa that use child labor. 

>ICE cars, while using fossil fuels, are more efficient than ever, have carbon filters, are reliable for short and long journeys, and with proper maintenance can last decades.

ICE efficiency improvements have slowed and are near a plateau due to the limitations of energy capture from the combustion process in a small engine.

EVs are just as reliable or more reliable than ICE vehicles and no matter how you cut it the long term environmental impact is significantly less than any mass market ICE vehicle is capable of. 

And you point to ""proper maintenance"", that relies on billions of people properly maintaining their vehicles for decades, that is a pipe dream. EVs even running inefficiently are multiple times more efficient than ICE vehicles in energy use. 

>And the electricity to charge EV's usually comes from fossil fuels anyway, so really the only thing it's helping reduce is air pollution, but then when the batteries overheat they can start uncontrollable fires and explosions that choke the air with smoke and chemicals.

Not accurate at all. It is very location dependent but areas like California that have the highest EV adoption rates have the much of their energy production renewable sources, nuclear that doesn't pollute, or low emissions natural gas.

And the ratio of CO2 emissions sources to green sources is shifting more to green sources every year. 

That is the important thing with EVs, there are options to have sources of clean non-polluting energy. Unlike ICE vehicles that will always have to burn fuel and emit some kind of exhaust by their very nature. 

>So are EV's really the smart green solution or is it a pipe dream?

Essentially taking the “weakness” (mass/inertia/etc) of a battery and turning it into a strength by making it low to the ground, and rigid mass that helps stiffen the frame of the vehicle. In order to achieve something like this with swappable batteries the frame would need to be MUCH stronger so that it could maintain it rigidity without the structure of the battery AND absorb/damped the “wobble” in the attachment points for said battery.

Against-EV,"To be honest this hypothesis sounds like an idea from 10 years ago and ignores a few basic manufacturing facts and the developments in battery and charging technology.

I just don't see how swapping in and out a huge battery pack is in anyway going to be cheaper or faster then charging electrons. And that's ignoring the extra design restrictions (meaning extra costs) needed to make swapping out batteries a plausible endeavour on thousands of 'battery swapping stations'. These design constrictions alone make this a fairy tale.

On top of that come the improvements from the past years and expected improvements the coming years. in battery price, density and longelivety and the charging rate.

The audi e-tron charges 150kW most of the charging time. That means like 3 or 400 km in half an hour right? It'll be a huge challenge to swap out a battery pack in that time and even if that could go slightly faster it will involve more manpower increasing costs and will be made obsolete by even faster charging rates that are to be expected in the coming years. Just look at this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPrVZtzAqX4 that is 300 km in half an hour charging right now on an 350kW charger also existing right now. I give it a couple of years but then we will actually see cars charging with 300 kW, it just needs cooling the cable and battery pack, not an impossible job and something you will want to do anyway.

And then, even if you really believe swapping out a battery pack weighing hundreds of kilo's will be better then fast charging, you completely ignore the Obvious advantage that you can actually charge your battery also at home. 

I'm sorry but I honestly believe that your idea won't be taken seriously by anyone with engineering experience in the automobile industy, just thinking about all the practical problems with designing a car where you can swap out hundreds of kilo's of battery from the bottom is daunting. VW has been stating that production of the id.3 became pretty cheap in part due to having an integrated battery pack in their MEB platform reducing the need for additional constructions adding strength to the chassis. If you come up with a swappable battery you will actually need to design your car to also be able to stand on it's wheels with and without the huge battery pack.

edit: wait, reading your post again, you think you can swap out a battery in minutes? From a drivability point of view you need to position the heavy batteries at the bottom of the car. Have you seen how large the battery pack of a car with 400 km range is? In what universe will swapping out something like that only take minutes? the fact that it is hundreds of kilos make swapping out a battery not only difficult it also become an activity involving serious safety concerns for employees and the driver lifting up a heavy weight battery pack.

Against-EV,"I have sent e-mails and made phone calls to the management of many local shopping centres, I'm always met with an apathetic/dismissive response if one at all. Even Whole Foods, which in the US I believe is very environmentally friendly and has lots of chargers, here in the Toronto area none of the 3 locations I emailed are even slightly interested, they all gave me an outright no, not now, not ever while I'm in charge. It's not even a matter of installing stations, this is what has happened with some already-installed stations here:

One of our Ikea locations here (all of them have 2xL2 and 2xL3) has had one of its two L2 stations broken for over 7 months. I emailed them and they brushed it off, I followed up and they ignored me.

A local shopping mall installed 4 ChargePoint stations, and put up no ""EV Parking Only"" signage. At least some of the spaces are always ICEd, sometimes all of them--it's gotten a bit better but it's still bad enough that I've just stopped going there. I emailed management and they told me outright they don't care if the spots are ICEd, and if I dislike it I should shop elsewhere. No idea why they spent probably ~$100K on installation and pay ChargePoint upwards of $1K a year in subscription costs to keep the stations running.

Another shopping mall has 14 chargepoint stations. 4 of them in one parkade are ICEd 99% of the time, security does nothing. The other 10 are maybe 40% ICEd on average. The stations cost $2/hr up to $5 max; 1) I mentioned to management that fee is basically telling me to get out of their mall as soon as possible and not stay to spend a hell of a lot more than that at their stores, vs malls with free charging incentivizing me to visit and stay longer and spend money, they didn't seem remotely close to comprehending this notion, 2) for that matter, they didn't care that the ICE vehicles are costing them that $2/hr station use fee.

A parking garage downtown received a government grant to install L2 and L3 stations, 100% funded (stations and installation) by taxpayer money. They assigned that level of the garage to a car rental company that blocked each and every station with ICE vehicles, they posted signs stating that using the stations was strictly prohibited, period. This is in violation of the terms of their grant, the government did absolutely nothing.

The City government operates 3 lots with charging stations. One of them used to be private, it was a large gated lot with 5 L2 stations outside the gated area, pay parking for all vehicles except FREE parking AND charging for EVs; the City bought it and went through the expense of installing payment machines with a $16 daily rate for EVs outside the gated area, and they pay a parking enforcement officer wages to drive over and inspect the previously free _mere 5 spaces_. At that garage, the stations are extremely unreliable, the private lot owners didn't fix them in ~2 years and the City hasn't in the last year or two. The other two garages with two L2s each are ICEd most of the time; one of them probably 99% of the time there are ICEs in both spaces, the other one maybe 99% of the time one space is ICEd and 80% of the time the second space is too. At one of the garages, the EV spaces are within eyesight of the parking office; I have gone to the office at each location many times and asked them to at least ticket, if not tow, the ICEs, as they are supposed to do per the signage at the spaces, they refuse every time. I escalated it to my city councillor as I was displeased I paid, through my tax dollars, tens of thousands per lot for the stations to be installed, they said they'd look into it and never did, started blowing me off--nobody will ever vote the guy out, though, big name.

In my local commuter train station, there are 2 L2 stations signed EV parking while charging only. I would say 70% of the time, both spaces are ICEd and/or blocked by EVs using them as priority parking while not plugged in since the stations cost $2.50 per session - the station's parking is notoriously full so some EV drivers park there for the convenience despite it being prohibited. Called transit parking enforcement, they said they'd send somebody, they didn't--**5 days in a row**. One of those days there was a transit enforcement vehicle parked at the station and I knocked on the window and asked if they were there to ticket the ICE/EVholes--they said no, I explained the situation, they said they don't write tickets for that. I escalated it and was given every assurance they'd take it more seriously; surely enough, the next day I called and someone got a **$20 ticket**. The next several days the same car was back and they did not ticket it again or tow it.

The remaining 30% of the time, those stations are in use. I have never gone to this station and been able to charge. Adjacent to the 2 parking spaces with L2s, there are 3 parking spaces with 120V outlets that are turned off and ready-to-go wiring for 3 more L2 stations, with signs that have said ""future electric vehicle charging station"" for about 6 years. I emailed the transit agency which proved useless; I contacted my elected representative who had authority over the transit agency and explained the situation, asking at least for the 3 spaces to be signed EV only and have the 120V outlets turned on, and preferably install 3 charging stations given that the wiring was 100% ready to go and the signage saying ""future station"" had been there for 6 years, they dismissed all of my contact attempts.

Against-EV,"It probably won't happen.  Most EVs are not designed with a battery that can be swapped.  You can do that with a $100k car but not with a $30 to $40k car.  

The battery is going to live a very long time unless you live in a very hot climate and have an EV with no cooling system or drive a zillion miles year (say > 25k).  

The bigger challenge is getting automakers to come out with low cost BEVs that will meet most customer's range requirements in a cold winter and after 8 years of use.  Let's say a typical driver needs 50 miles of range... actually let's add 20% for errands and make it 60 miles of range per day.  And they want at least that same range in a cold winter after 8 years of use,  then, assuming 30% capacity loss and 30% range loss in a cold winter, an EV would need an initial range of 60/(1-.30)/(1-.30) =  122 miles.  The 2016 LEAF will almost have that range and the 2017 Chevy Bolt (and possibly 2017 LEAF) will have significantly more than that.  I think that the most cost effective solution would be BEVs with 125 to 150 miles range.

Against-EV,"> but given the realities of the EV market for everyone but Tesla

Those ""realities"" are the way they are because nobody else even *tries* to make a good EV with long range, the way Tesla does. Case in point: BMW.

It's what I've been saying in another comment recently, too, when there was a thread saying we should embrace PHEVs because that ""helps"" the EV market. PHEVs make car makers *lazy*, because they think they can *get away* with using old ICE car platforms with tiny batteries that can be ""augmented"" by gas. 

If they trick customers into thinking the same way, and think that ""eh, why bother with an EV - a PHEV suits me just fine in 90% of the cases"", that will *not* be good for the EV market. And people will be stuck with cars that now have *two* power trains that both require maintenance.

As batteries become better, PHEVs will/should be phased out almost completely. And BMW will just lose a lot of time not trying to make good EVs and gain expertise. 

Also, what you seem to be saying with this post is that ""Guys, you got BMW all wrong - it's not that they're trying to *refocus* away from EVs, it's that BMW *never* cared about EVs that much in the first place!""

Is that supposed to make us feel any better? Either way, BMW can do whatever it wants. It will be their loss, as everyone else races past them with great EVs and starts stealing sales from both their ICE and PHEV cars. I could care less if BMW, which [can't even send secure updates](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2016/02/bmw-are-sending-their-software-updates-unencrypted/) to its cars, and now suddenly wants us to trust them that they'll make such good and ""safe"" self-driving cars, dies out.",given reality market everyone reality way nobody else even try good long range way case point bmw saying another comment recently thread saying embrace phevs help market phevs maker lazy think away using old ice platform tiny augmented gas trick customer thinking way think eh bother phev suit fine case good market stuck two power train require maintenance become better phevs willshould phased almost completely bmw lose lot time trying good gain expertise seem saying post guy got bmw wrong trying refocus away bmw never cared much first place supposed u feel better either way bmw whatever want loss everyone else race past great start stealing sale ice phev could care less bmw even send secure update suddenly want u trust good safe selfdriving dy,125

Against-EV,">The appeal of EVs has entirely shifted from being an environmental choice to instead giving everyone the horsepower of a sports car, in the sizes of a pickup truck. And I think this is an environmental disaster.

I think you're not getting how a transition to a new technology works. You go from the top down in terms of profitable market sectors until your production capacity and material availability, like batteres,  has caught up.

BTW: from an environmental perspective we should be glad that the upper market segments (SUVs, pickup trucks, ...) are served first. Because those are the gas guzzlers that need to come off the road a lot more urgently than the relatively efficient/low mileage compact cars. People who buy SUVs aren't just going to buy a subcompact as their next car because you want them to.

Smaller EVs will come when the upper market segments are saturated (and also when the production processes tried out for these cars - like megacastings or cell-to-chassis architectures) make mass production cheaper.

As for power and large batteries: Power is not an issue in EVs. It's cheap to have a powerful motor. This isn't like in ICE cars where adding 100hp means a vastly more expensive/larger/heavier engine.  Battery life goes by cycles. A large battery in a larger car will give you roughly the same utility (in miles travelled) as two smaller ones in smaller cars. So you're not having any significant impact on the environment by asking for smaller batteries. (If anything its the other way around. In a large battery car you can take a holiday trip where that isn't something you would do, comfortably, in a small battery car. Those would instead fly - which is *much* worse for the environment)",appeal entirely shifted environmental choice instead giving everyone horsepower sport size pickup truck think environmental disaster think getting transition technology work go top term profitable market sector production capacity material availability batteres caught way environmental perspective glad upper market segment suv pickup truck served first gas guzzler come road lot urgently relatively efficientlow mileage compact buy suv going buy subcompact next want smaller come upper market segment saturated production process tried megacastings celltochassis architecture mass production cheaper power large power issue cheap powerful motor ice adding hp mean vastly expensivelargerheavier engine life go cycle large larger give roughly utility mile travelled two smaller smaller significant impact environment asking smaller anything way around large take holiday trip something comfortably small instead fly much worse environment,124
Against-EV,">Electric batteries require mining lithium, cobalt and other metals that have devastating environmental impacts

Newer battery technologies use little to no cobalt. Lithium isn't really ""mined"" it is extracted from heavy brine sources but that just means evaporating off the excess water. Mining other resources are not more damaging or impactful than oil drilling and refinement. 

>use child labour (I think we'll need to increase this mining upwards of 6 times if we all start using EV's)

New mining is primarily in countries or regions that have strong child labor laws. As mentioned above, cobalt mining is being less important for battery production and most, if not all, car manufacturers are changing to source raw materials outside of areas like central Africa that use child labor. 

>ICE cars, while using fossil fuels, are more efficient than ever, have carbon filters, are reliable for short and long journeys, and with proper maintenance can last decades.

ICE efficiency improvements have slowed and are near a plateau due to the limitations of energy capture from the combustion process in a small engine.

EVs are just as reliable or more reliable than ICE vehicles and no matter how you cut it the long term environmental impact is significantly less than any mass market ICE vehicle is capable of. 

And you point to ""proper maintenance"", that relies on billions of people properly maintaining their vehicles for decades, that is a pipe dream. EVs even running inefficiently are multiple times more efficient than ICE vehicles in energy use. 

>And the electricity to charge EV's usually comes from fossil fuels anyway, so really the only thing it's helping reduce is air pollution, but then when the batteries overheat they can start uncontrollable fires and explosions that choke the air with smoke and chemicals.

Not accurate at all. It is very location dependent but areas like California that have the highest EV adoption rates have the much of their energy production renewable sources, nuclear that doesn't pollute, or low emissions natural gas.

And the ratio of CO2 emissions sources to green sources is shifting more to green sources every year. 

That is the important thing with EVs, there are options to have sources of clean non-polluting energy. Unlike ICE vehicles that will always have to burn fuel and emit some kind of exhaust by their very nature. 

>So are EV's really the smart green solution or is it a pipe dream?

Against-EV,"tl;dr: this post is full of FUD. Either willfully ignorant to discredit EVs, or due to having faulty information fed to you.

-----

1. I don't know of a single ""activist"" that is ""demanding plug-in hybrids be discontinued."" Any electrification is good.

2. Level 2 charging isn't meant to be the ""rapid charging on a trip"". That's what DC charging is for. Your post history shows you're in California - which has *PLENTY* of DC rapid charging.

3. Charging at home is the preferred method, because you start out each day with a full battery. It takes literally a few extra seconds when you get home, and a few extra seconds when you leave to plug/unplug. For the overwhelming majority of people, overnight charging on even a ""Level 1"" (standard household socket) will cover their daily commute.  Yes, there are people for whom that wouldn't work. So you spend $300-$1000 installing a 240V EVSE in their garage/side-of-house, and that can charge every EV other than a Hummer EV from 0-100% in under 12 hours. 

The whole point of moving to an EV is that you don't treat it like a gasoline car. You don't ""fill up once a week"" - you top off each night.

Your ""family holiday"" example is assuming only level 2 charging. Level 3 charging is obviously *significantly* faster and is what you should be using on a road trip. When you road trip in a gas car, you don't stop and pick up 1 gallon cans of gas every few dozen miles, you fill up quickly all at once.

   4 . Yes, EVs tend to cost more than an equivalent ICE vehicle up front - but one of the main points is that you are saving more than that difference. There are banks that take this in to account for auto loans, being willing to loan you more for an EV than an ICE, knowing that your car payment may be higher, but you can afford it because you have much lower fuel+maintenance payments. 

Combined with the fact that because EVs are in high demand, most of them being sold are ""higher end"". So you're not comparing a Tesla Model 3 to a Honda Civic. You're comparing it to a BMW 3-Series. Where it *IS* price competitive.  There are cheaper EVs, like the Chevy Bolt. And the Ford F-150 Lightning Pro is a *STEAL*. I honestly don't know how Ford can sell it for $40,000.

Lastly, the average selling price of new vehicles has risen across the board - not just EVs. The average new car price is now *[over $47,000](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-pricing-negotiation/average-new-car-price-all-time-high-a4060089312/)* - partly because of demand. No, that isn't ""affordable"" either, the whole market needs to drop in price. But it isn't just an EV thing. EVs will drop in price as the whole car market does.

In the town I live, as in most towns, there are several 50kW CCS chargers for a quick charge.

I fully agree with you that 200-250 mil range is good enough.  Besides this, where I live BEVs do not pay the yearly tax as the tax is proportional to the level of CO2 the car produces and a BEV does not produce CO2. I guess it is similar in California.

Against-EV,"You use the carwow results without mentioning why the results came out as they did: **heating method**

Cars like the Niro have a heat pump, while the Model 3 does not.   So the Model 3 loses more range in the winter.  Results would be different in the summer, but it hardly matters because none of it has anything to do with drivetrain efficiency.  

I do agree that Tesla doesn't have a huge lead on drivetrain efficiency for the simple reason that EV drivetrains are already efficient so there are only very small gains to be made.  

Reality is though, people don't care about efficiency, they care about range.   And they only care about range on the highway, since every modern EV has enough range for city driving.   

So what really matters is how fast can you travel on long trips.  For that, Bjorn does the 1000km challenges.  Driving 1000km with fast charging at normal highway speeds.   Here are the results:
[1000km Challenge Results](https://i.imgur.com/d4oTyik.png)

Clear that there are three tiers of EVs right now.  

1. Top tier with fast charging with long range that can average near 100km/h.   That's all the Teslas and the Audi eTron, and Porsche Taycan.  
2. Mid tier with medium charging and long range.  Hyundai Kona, Kia Niro, Kia Soul, etc.   About 15% slower travel time than the top tier.  Note that the charging speed is the determinant there, with even the low range original 28kWh Ioniq getting close to this performance due to its relatively fast  (70kW) charging.
3. Lower tier with slow charging and medium/long range.  Nissan Leaf and eGolf fall into this category due to poor charging performance.

Against-EV,"In my experience (about 25-30k miles on CCS, public or ""non-Tesla"" charging) reliability is the issue first and foremost. That's not to say that everything you mentioned is not a problem, only that reliability is that miserable. 

There is nothing more aggravating than having to change stalls just to get a charge, or to get a decent rate.  Find a stall, park, pull up the app, punch in the station/stall code, plug in while holding the top part of the CCS charger (communication part) tight against the car and hope that it initiates, wait to see if it starts and gives full power, rinse and fucking repeat if it doesn't.

That's all before you can even spend the time charging. I've been complaining about this for a couple years and have been met on Reddit by the Electrify America Defense Force that loudly claims the chargers always work perfectly for them ([except](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/w6ap7e/get_it_together_electrify_america/), [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/x1v0u7/another_ea_bad_post_36_chargers_broken_3_cars/), [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/x2jlmi/electrify_america_sucks_brunswick_ga_is_down_04/), [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/wv159v/state_of_us_ccs_infrastructure/), [they](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/pazlrh/some_thoughts_after_a_long_trip/), [are](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/vro3uh/electrify_america_unavailable_rate_is_crazy/), [not](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/wv1bl1/electrify_america_get_your_act_together/), [always](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ur11gh/imo_road_trips_simply_not_practical_in_southeast/), [perfect](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/swcep4/why_are_level_3_chargers_so_unreliable/))

That coupled with the fact that it was one of the best looking sedans on the road made me feel like I owned a discount Ferrari :). I had the sport interior in red, the thing looked amazing.

Like you mentioned the drive by wire can be laggy, the start stop is annoying as hell(I turned it off). Sometimes the response off the line is slow (mine was a 2017 so they have fixed that now).  Also in my the infotainment system rebooted it self once in a couple of weeks :).

I totaled my Guilia last week :(. I miss it like hell. Waiting on the outcome, and will likely go the same route again.

&#x200B;

Edit:

I had 10k miles on my car when it got totaled. It didn't a single issue, rattle etc. The thing was really well built, and I would own an other in a heartbeat. Just wanted to add since folks are skeptical on its reliability and build quality.

Against-EV,"Congrats on the drive! That boaty feeling is quite odd, but the GTC greatly improves on it and makes the front feel more connected. I was hoping these would depreciate a little bit more, but with the new generation dropping the transaxle they'll probably only go up :(

You also hit on precisely why this sets itself apart from the 911 and other sports cars of its era, it's a luxury street car first and foremost. You get a fantastic sound system, 360 cameras, adaptive cruise, and a cushy interior with nice aircon and wonderful seats. 

You can probably DD a 911 if you try hard enough, and yes the newer cars do have surround cameras and all the tech, but it still feels like a track car thats been adapted into a road one. Granted, my experience is mainly with the GT models, but by the gearing and suspension you can tell the car its just yearning to be on the track. 

The GT on the other hand is too civilized, often to its own detriment. 

Other notes: 

> One thing I did like is the fact that the blind spot detection system does beep at you if it feels like you are going to merge while it is activated

Merc's blindspot assist is incredibly simple and intuitive. I wish more manufacturers would just steal it. 

> So I’ll chalk that up to a combo of “that’s what you get with a convertible” and “that’s what you get with a rental car” and I’m sure the hardtop AMG-GT’s are much more quiet/solid on the highway.

I really wish merc had kept around the hardtop convertible for just a bit longer, it solved this issue beautifully. I recommend you try out an slk55 if you can find one around you, it's an extremely interesting car and a thrilling experience.

Against-EV,"I work on BEVs (range/climate simulations & testing) for an OEM and here are my personal observations for the MCT & real-world-range -  

 * MCT is mostly a low-speed test cycle (55% weighting to city-cycle (20mph avg) and 45% weighting to highway-cycle (48mph-avg). Consequently, non-aero loads are magnified in importance (having larger/additional display screen will show large impact to EPA-range, whereas impact at 70mph would be negligible). 

 * Not all OEMs use the 0.7 factor. Some use a lot higher factor than justified, some are conservative.

 * For towing with BEV Trucks/SUVs, Battery-capacity/range will likely never match that of an ICE vehicle; unless you are driving at slow-speeds. 

 * Finally, if your primary commute is on the freeway, buy a vehicle with the lowest aero & largest battery.

4) Middle income people (the bulk of taxpayers and the bulk of consumers) actually study the numbers and make their own informed decision.

5) Manufacturers who were encouraged by the rush from early adopters and the wealthy - suddenly are scratching their heads that EV demand is flatlining. They are forced to adjust prior targets. 

6) What happens next is anybody’s guess. Governments could increase pressure eg via taxation - but history shows us that forcing people to do something rarely ends well.

Against-EV,">Isn’t green at all

Correct, it’s not. But over time, you have a break-even point in terms of the emissions created building the car balanced out by the lack of emissions from the car. Also, remember ICE cars aren’t only creating emissions themselves, there’s the emissions in oil drilling and refining, transporting the gas to stations, etc.

Ideally in the future, you’ll have EVs being powered by grids running on predominantly cleaner power sources than coal/fossil fuels, so you’ll be offsetting increased emissions from building EVs simply by driving them.  

I agree on the mining - it’s is a different story, which I don’t know the solution for. 

>How many tons of waste in 10 years

Volkswagen has already created a lithium battery recycling plant in Germany. Nissan uses old Leaf batteries to power some of their assembly line. Tesla recycles the copper/cobalt/and chemicals used for cooling, and has a way of freezing and destroying the remainder of the pack in a way that’s not harmful to soil. - Developments like this will only improve with time.

>If a country like the USA doesn’t have the infrastructure…

Pretty much no countries truly have the infrastructure, but this will change as adoption increases. And I suspect that even in smaller less developed countries, this will change as well with time - but infrastructure is likely the most valid argument against owning EVs at the moment, especially for those who can’t charge where they live (which as much as EV owners want to say otherwise, is a solid portion of people).

As for power delivery, this is an issue separate from EVs specifically, but yes. Countries (and their power industries) should be making strides towards more renewable/cleaner sources of energy. Some are, some aren’t, this isn’t a political/business conversation and is a whole different can of worms not for this sub.

>Greener to buy a used ICE car than an EV

Well, technically yes, but there’s only a finite supply of used cars to buy, and in the future as ICE (very slowly) gets phased out, it’ll be even tougher to find. - And it’s not as though EVs just get thrown in the trash after their first owner. Battery degradation isn’t linear, and even a Tesla Model X with 400,000 miles only saw about an 11% decrease in capacity - so it’s not like everyone will have to throw away their EV when it hits 100k. You’ll still have a used market so there’s solid life to be gotten out of each EV.

Against-EV,"In my experience (about 25-30k miles on CCS, public or ""non-Tesla"" charging) reliability is the issue first and foremost. That's not to say that everything you mentioned is not a problem, only that reliability is that miserable. 

There is nothing more aggravating than having to change stalls just to get a charge, or to get a decent rate.

Against-EV,"I think one of the largest issues with your strategy of replacing ONLY the motor is one of battery issues. 
1) Batteries are far less energy dense than a comparable weight in gasoline. This added weight forces engineers to redesign suspension systems, by and large, to get ""sportier feel"", weight should be minimized and suspension should be stiffer. The excess battery weight forces engineers to sacrifice ride quality for ""sporty feel"", much more than a lighter gas equivalent vehicle would.

2) Brakes on electric vehicles are for the most part ""regenerative"". Regenerative breaking takes some of the control away from the driver, putting a priority on energy harvesting, not pedal feel. To compensate for the energy lost by not using regenerative braking to improve pedal feel you'd have to sacrifice range, or add weight by adding batteries

3) No gear shift. Nothing says I'm a car snob in the US than driving a manual. It's a much more interactive experience, and something that electric cars don't really provide.

TL;DR The things that make electric cars less fun are actually also happening to Gasoline cars to improve efficiency. Humans are exceptionally bad control systems.

The battery charges much faster when it's closer to empty and that last 20% is very slow.

You mentioned ""much like Tesla"" which is why I put in that caveat since they only gain about 170 miles of range in half an hour and Superchargers have 2 plugs per circuit and if a second car plugs into your circuit your charging speed will be reduced. Also it should be noted that the advertised combined range of 315 miles for the Model S P100 is based on a 55mph highway speed.

To expand my view about this though none of these options would be ideal in my opinion which is why I'm hoping hydrogen fuel cell cars take off. 5 minutes to a 300-400 mile range is better than any of the pure electrical charging options.

They should be at least offering really bare-bones EVs with battery packs that are upgrade-able (and physically re-configurable) as easily as pulling up the seat and snapping additional battery capacity. It should be like adding RAM into a PC. There should be assorted power levels of motors available that are interchangeable between vehicle models in a given manufacturer line, if even interchangeable between manufacturers.

Against-EV,"It would have been, but if not cars, than something else. As far back as the invention of the wheel people have always needed some mode of independent transportation for specific trips or for hauling stuff around. The car replaced the horse and carriage, the truck replaced the horse and wagon - or whatever other critter used for pulling or packing (donkey, camel, etc). 

Unfortunately with the car the way we live changed dramatically. People live further away from urban centres than they ever have before, and we expect modern services like hospitals. Nothing can compete with the automobile for that need. 

When I think of a “car-free society” I don’t imagine a throwback to the pre-industrial era but rather a life where cars are not necessary for most people. 

The cat’s out of the bag for the automobile. Complete abolition, at least in my part of the world, is both practically and politically impossible. For nearly a hundred years the car has represented freedom and independence, and nobody likes to give that up. Even for people who don’t own one, rentals or sharing are important. As are services like taxis.

Against-EV,"Long post, but.....

It's all possible, but we live in a ***very*** complicated and connected environment.  Yes, we could replace ICE vehicles with electric, but that has plenty of downsides as well.  And capitalism isn't necessarily all bad.  It just needs serious guard rails.  It kind of boils down to ***awareness*** and ***priorities*** (global, not personal).  Here are some issues to consider:

* Fossil fuels have a much higher energy density than renewables, making it already an uphill climb if we are just going to replace ICE vehicles with electric.
* Externalities are a thing, and usually left to the consumer/society to deal with.  There is a huge landfill mound just north of Hartford, CT that was just a field 40 years ago.  Whoever made the stuff in it likely didn't pay for its disposal.  And, if I'm not mistaken, Germany has some kind of regulation where the manufacturer of refrigerators are required to take them back and the end of their life.  And many countries in the EU have minimum requirements for recyclable components.
* Scalability is a thing, too.  We need to understand the sheer scope of the task at hand.  Just in the US (assuming that my quick search of number of households that use fossil fuels directly for heat is correct at 40M), if we are to meet the goal of using heat pumps for these cases by 2050, we would need to manufacture almost 6,000 heat pumps every working day.  
* And last, but not least, on the hit list:  time.  Every day we delay a serious attempt at solving the issue(s) means we have a steeper hill to climb, and, at some point, the hill will become too steep.  (This is where capitalism fails, and in some ways inhibits progress.)  There are so many moving parts to the solutions that all developments need to be planned as you would a major construction effort (because it is).  Just in the US, 80M houses will need way more insulation than they have.  40M houses will need conversion to heat pumps or other alternative heat sources.  Charging stations will need to be planned and constructed to handle the new load.  The electric grid needs to be updated.  (In Vermont, they put a limit on grid tied solar panels because the grid couldn't handle it.)

And my last comment is this:  We really need to rethink HOW and WHY we do what we do.  Instead of just living like we always have and replacing things with like things, let's think about how we can do stuff differently and more sustainably.  Even if we replace ICE cars with electric, we're still throwing away about 300M tires per year.  How can we adjust our habits/processes so issues like this are no longer issues.  Again, just being aware of the moving pieces will help a lot.  

Do I think we (collectively) will get to this point in time?  Sadly, no.  We're aiming to keep the CO2 warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2050. Recent reporting from a number of sources indicate that we will blow past that in the next decade.   Will the earth survive?  Yup.  Will society as we know it survive?

Against-EV,"There is no comparison to the power of legislative / policy actions that limit and reduce our activities which are harmful to the environment. People who believe they do good for the environment may be less likely to perform a potentially more impactful action later on, like voting or protesting. Look up self-licensing and the moral credential effect.

I had a friend who asked me why I didn't buy a hybrid. It was important to him that ""everyone do their part"". So I ran the numbers.

In Canada, with data ranging from 2015 - 2022, the average person emits 19 tonnes of GHGs per year. Approximately 12.5% of that is on a personal vehicle, or 2.5 tonnes per year. Changing from a gas to hybrid vehicle could improve that to 1.5 tonnes, an overall personal improvement of 8% - not bad.

Compare this to Sweden, with only 4.5 tonnes emitted per person per year thanks to countless government policies which encourage low GHG emissions.

It's not even comparable. 19 tonnes to 4.5. You don't get to one quarter the emissions by buying a hybrid, using biodegradable soap, or whatever else some marketing department wants you to spend your money on.

Canada could cut its per capita GHG emissions by 25% by modernizing residential building code to meet base LEED certification (very rough calculations). But this is not what we're doing, because the large home building corporations would fight it tooth and nail. 

Instead, in Canada, we have the Greener Homes Grant, which offers a variety of rebates for improvements to a person's home's energy efficiency. Almost none are cost effective to the consumer. Of the four people I know who participated in the program, two made significant upgrades - notably, retiring their gas furnaces and ACs for heat pumps. Both said the upgrades were not financially beneficial to them, but that they wanted to do it as they wanted to make an impact. Both of their households likely earn in the top 10% in the country. You can probably see why a program like this is problematic.

Of course BP would rather you spend your personal money to buy whatever the heck you want. If 1% of the top 10% of Canadians (by earnings) switch to electric heat pumps, big deal. The point is that they later voted for parties that won't threaten their bottom line with major policy changes.

Against-EV,"It's so complicated to figure this kind of thing out. The way I think about at it is that it depends on the exact product and the source or means by which you got it.

1. Were the funds used towards a new replacement by the previous owner?
2. Has the purchase avoided some toxic fate for the item?

With cars #1 is a huge problem. If you look at dealers where there are cars that are only two or three years old, they're either quick turnarounds from the original owners, old rental fleets, or lease returns. The original owners rely on the secondary market to finance buying new cars every two or three years. How many private deals have sellers who say ""well we just got a new car so this one needs to find a new home""? If the price is more than a pittance, whoever buys their old one is subsidizing the new one. This is particularly the case when like is replaced with like, not necessarily when a change of type occurs (such as have kids, got a minivan; or recently retired, don't need a truck).

The same can be said for any consumer goods. If there's a significant secondary market, it's inevitably propping up a primary market. But there's a threshold, which I think depends on local conditions and the exact item, where this is a factor. If someone buys a new $1000 TV and lists their old one for like $100 or $50, the sale of the old TV was never a factor. That person may have let it just sit in storage somewhere, give it to a family member, etc. If it was, say, $500 or $600, you just paid for most of their new TV.

Similar sorts of subsidizing wasteful lifestyles can be found in student towns. Wealthier students frequently buy new everything at the beginning of their stay at school and abandon it, often selling it off, when they go home. If they were permanently out the few thousand bucks it cost in the first place they wouldn't be consuming so much.

Donation-driven thrift stores are a great example of a secondary market being completely disconnected from the primary, since they don't create an incentive to replace the goods that they receive. Clothes at places like Goodwill are the best example of this IMO. Not only is a ""thrifted"" shirt NOT subsidizing the production of new ones - in fact it's reducing the amount of new ones made - it's also diverting that shirt from landfill.

There are some weird grey areas with certain electronics I can think of where there's a trade off to be made, and that lives in some large corporate sectors of IT. Many companies have policies where they replace computers etc every three to five years (""hardware refresh cycle""). Their old systems inevitably hit the secondary market. Sometimes, depending on age and company, the accountants may have completely written the items down and they get carted off at an extremely cheap auction (government surplus auctions are famous for this) or there may be a deal in place that buys them, which is a little incentive to replace them sooner. The thing is with these items, if there was no secondary market, in the corporate eye the usefulness is still very limited so they might stay in service for a year or two more. If they can't just sell them off, they'll go for scrap, which unfortunately is still a toxic process. And they'll still buy new ones. Because of that, it makes much more sense to buy something like an off-lease computer than an off-lease car.

On the plus side, secondary markets create all kinds of employment that is (sometimes) not directly coupled to the exploitation of natural resources and manufacturing pollution. Especially with repaired, refurbished, and remanufactured items.

Like Early Grey Tea said reducing demand for some items is very important. In my part of the world the main drivers of computer upgrades are slow software, and the main driver of new cars is road salt. Better upgradability and repairability would of course help but until these factors are mitigated then the secondary market is largely about personally saving money because all these items have fixed lifetimes and must constantly be replaced.

So for your TV, it's hard to say. How much power did your old one use versus the new? What is the primary source of electricity in your area? Where would you have been able to find a new-to-you used TV that you like? What's the average lifetime before cost to repair is so high you have to get a replacement unit?",complicated figure kind way think depends exact product source mean got fund used towards replacement previous owner purchase avoided toxic fate item huge problem look dealer two three old either quick turnaround original owner old rental fleet lease return original owner rely secondary market finance buying every two three many private deal seller say well got find home price pittance whoever buy old subsidizing particularly case replaced necessarily change type occurs kid got minivan recently retired truck said consumer good significant secondary market inevitably propping primary market threshold think depends local condition exact item factor someone buy tv list old sale old tv never factor person may let sit storage somewhere give family member etc say paid tv similar sort subsidizing wasteful lifestyle found student town wealthier student frequently buy everything beginning stay school abandon often selling go home permanently thousand buck cost first place consuming much donationdriven thrift store great example secondary market completely disconnected primary since create incentive replace good receive clothes place goodwill best example going thrifted shirt subsidizing production fact reducing amount made diverting shirt landfill weird grey area certain electronics think trade made life large corporate sector many policy replace computer etc every three five hardware refresh cycle old system inevitably hit secondary market sometimes depending age accountant may completely written item carted extremely cheap auction government surplus auction famous may deal place buy little incentive replace sooner item secondary market corporate eye usefulness still limited might stay service two sell go scrap unfortunately still toxic process still buy much sense buy something offlease computer offlease plus side secondary market create kind employment sometimes directly coupled exploitation natural resource manufacturing pollution especially repaired refurbished remanufactured item early grey tea said reducing demand item important part world main driver computer upgrade slow software main driver road salt better upgradability repairability course help factor mitigated secondary market largely personally saving money item fixed lifetime must constantly replaced tv hard say much power old use versus primary source electricity area able find newtoyou used tv average lifetime cost repair high replacement unit,344

There are a lot of things that you can do to improve your buildings sustainability. Never underestimate a good recycling program. Contact your city and ask for recycling been there might be a small fee for it but it's usually worth it and affordable specially for a company. You can try and implement certain things that prevent food waste such as composting. You could do motion sensor lights in the bathrooms you just have to set the sensor for a little bit longer for people who take their time but it's a very effective way to cut down on energy cost considering that you don't have to leave a light on all day. If your company purchases small silverware or paper towels or napkins you can always get recycled products instead of brand-new products. Sustainability is also about health, you could do things like no elevator Fridays. Not everyone will participate but if you leave by example you might get a couple people to join in. You could try and do low flow toilets which are very useful you could also do the timed sink faucets, those prevent water waste. And there's typically not a lot of bathrooms in the building so you should be able to do this for fairly inexpensive.

Of course there's always the extreme things like doing solar panels or like wind generators. But those are much more expensive and difficult options to pursue.

Against-EV,"TL;DR at the bottom  


Heres the thing about EVs compared to gas cars as far as a foot print goes. In the beginning a gas car will produce less overall emissions from when its metal in the earth to when it rolls of the assembly line compared to an EV equivalent since lithium-ion batteries are not easy or clean to manufacture at the moment. So day one of owning either, the gas car is cleaner.   


Say you drive either for two years/ 10,000 miles (based on you driving roughly half of the average, for those of you who drive the average of about 12,000 miles thats only one year), in some circumstances the gasoline car will have produced slightly less overall footprint than the comparable gasoline car (it is heavily dependent on energy production and the car itself), but by year 3 or 4 (2/3 if you drive 12k\~ miles) the EV will almost always become cleaner than the gasoline car, because its environmental efficiency adds up in the fact it isn't directly burning fuel when driven compared to gas cars. That manufacturing footprint wont go away, but by now it is beating out the cost that would be incurred of driving a gas car is now more than the EVs foot print.   


To tie into your car, hybrids are still very clean. While an older Prius may not stack up as well compared to a newer hybrid or EV as the battery has aged, it's still a relatively green car. Even considering a new hybrid is worth the look as much as the EV, since many new plug-in hybrids (especially if you have short drive times) will run on battery power most of the time anyway, meaning that the reduction of emissions is still there almost as much as an EV.   


At the end in my opinion the question is how much do you need a new car. if you dont need one why waste money, but if you do need (or really want) a new car and have the money, both EVs and Hybrids are worth the look. There are also other alternative fuels (diesel, bio diesel, propane, hydrogen, E86, etc, which all have ups and downs), and i think most of these are worth considering.   


While the footprint of manufacturing an EV will likely be bigger than it will say 5 years from now, driving a gas car for 5 years will have a bigger footprint than the manufacturing cost to the environment since they produce larger yearly emissions (one source i found while writing the paper this is based on put gas sedans at about 5.2 tons of CO2 per year and a comparable EV at 2 tons per year. Manufacturing is much different, it can range so far so it is hard to calculate).   


My personal opinion: If you are set on replacing your car, looking at new or used hybrids and EVs are both good options, but if you cant find something that works, an efficient gasoline is not the end of the world. Well, at least just one of them wont be.   
TL;DR : In the long run, an EV would be cleaner than buying and driving a gas car now and waiting for the overall footprint of EV manufacturing to reduce itself. Another great option is (plug in) hybrids, as they tend to have a good middle ground and in many cases will function like an EV since the battery has enough power to get most places.",tldr bottom compared gas far foot print go beginning gas produce less overall emission metal earth roll assembly line compared equivalent since lithiumion easy clean manufacture moment day owning either gas cleaner say drive either two mile based driving roughly half average drive average mile circumstance gasoline produced slightly less overall footprint comparable gasoline heavily dependent production drive k mile almost always become cleaner gasoline environmental efficiency add fact directly burning fuel driven compared gas manufacturing footprint go away beating cost incurred driving gas foot print tie hybrid still clean older prius may stack well compared newer hybrid aged still relatively green even considering hybrid worth look much since many plugin hybrid especially short drive time run power time anyway meaning reduction emission still almost much end opinion question much waste money really want money hybrid worth look alternative fuel diesel bio diesel propane hydrogen e etc ups down think worth considering footprint manufacturing likely bigger say driving gas bigger footprint manufacturing cost environment since produce larger yearly emission source found writing paper based put gas sedan ton co per comparable ton per manufacturing much different range far hard calculate personal opinion set replacing looking used hybrid good option find something work efficient gasoline end world well least tldr long run cleaner buying driving gas waiting overall footprint manufacturing reduce another great option plug hybrid tend good middle ground many case function since enough power place,236

From what I remember, one example regarding plastic products is that it happens to be more expensive to use recycled plastic than to make virgin plastic.

Some?) sustainable companies try to source their materials/ingredients ethically and pay participants in the supply/production chain fair wages; a product can be much cheaper if it relies on sweatshop labor for example. Then when it comes to shopping at a local store rather than a big box chain, the local store doesn’t get the discount associated with purchasing in volume that the chain store might; and sometimes local stores might pay their employees better than, say, Walmart.

Against-EV,"The overall points made are worth talking about but it's hard to get past the constant defeatism laid on every attempt at transitioning away from fossil fuels. That and cringey terms such as ""technology priest"" and similar attempts at needless reframing of commentators, is off-putting. 

Maybe it's me, and I hope it is, but the trend of having an extreme 'position or no position', is tiresome and detrimental to shifting public opinion towards better lifestyle choices. You can't get a fence sitter to reduce consumption and invest in sustainability if there's this sentiment that nothing but the most extreme is going to do anything. People should be able choose chicken over beef or a hybrid over full EV without people saying it's not good enough. It's tone deaf and counterproductive. The real enemy is not the consumer. The idea that consumers dictate what industry does has been dead for decades. People are told what they want, and collectively, we mindlessly nod.

Whatever credentials this person has, they are ignoring how technology developes and spreads through societies.

Against-EV,"This is so exciting! Good on you for wanting to make a change! I have a lot of suggestions that I really think you’ll like.

1) Buy products from Etsy as opposed to Amazon, the company is carbon neutral, the businesses are small (thus generally more sustainable), and the items are either handmade or vintage. Just be sure not to get scammed lol, perhaps stick to shopping in your continent. I also know this isn’t necessarily an option if you don’t have the money.
2) Stop eating meat. If you can’t make the commitment, maybe start flexitarian, then pescatarian, then vegetarian, then vegan if you’re able. 
3) Stop using plastic bags and cling wrap! They make great reusable silicone baggies and bowl/dish covers. The key here is silicone, although plastic is alright if that’s all you can afford. Once again, I recommend Etsy for low waste items like these.
4) Buy any new clothing, dishes, etc second-hand. A big piece of a sustainable earth is a circular economy. Don’t buy new unless you have to (but also, you’re human, don’t feel ashamed if you treat yourself once in a blue moon.
5) If you wash your face and/or need to remove makeup, use reusable cotton rounds with micellar water (for makeup removal) or cotton face towels. Basically, don’t use any single use items on your face anymore.
6) Switch to toothpaste in an aluminum tube, like Hey Human toothpaste (I think that’s the brand name?).
7) If you want a single serve drink, purchase the ones not in plastic. For example, if you need a pre-made coffee, buy Starbucks in the glass containers instead of Dunkin in the plastic. Same goes for teas and juices, Nantucket Nectars, Honest Tea, and Snapple are a toss up, sometimes they’re plastic but other times they are glass.
8) Bring a reusable cup when you get coffee or tea. I do admit this is less convenient and not very possible right now with the pandemic.
9) Refuse plastic silverware during takeout, bring your own from home or purchase non-plastic collapsible ones.
10) I could be off about this one, but from my experience, powder laundry detergent comes in less plastic than liquid. Plus, let’s be honest, the liquid is a waste of water. Alternatively they make eco-friendly pods or sheets, but that can get pricey fast imo.
11) Buy your chapstick and deodorant in compostable packaging. Some companies like Old Spice and Dove are slowly implementing this, but also you can look to Etsy.
12) See if any products you use have a return program, either with Terracyle or on their own. The production of plastic is bad in and of itself however this is a good way to get rid of the packaging you already have or that other people have who won’t make the switch.
13) Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shave cream…all of it can be found in bar form. If you’re interested, I can send you the link to the shampoo bar I use, it’s super amazing.
14) If you get soft plastic bags for any reason (bread, shopping, toilet paper packaging, etc) you can return them to most stores and they’ll get recycled. Usually there’s a spot for them next to the trash and regular recycling. Target, Walmart, and Costco all do bag recycling for sure.
15) Turn off lights when you don’t need them
16) If you have the money, opt for bamboo toilet paper.
17) Bring your own takeout containers to restaurants instead of using their single-use plastic/styrofoam ones
18) Donate and sell your old items before just trashing them, if you really must get rid of them to begin with
19) Buy in bulk, it’s less plastic overall. For example, if you eat yogurt, buy the large 48oz tub instead of the individual servings.
20) A lot of local  recycling programs (in the USA) accept most plastics nowadays. I’m talking shampoo bottles, cleaning supply bottles, plastic coffee cups, yogurt containers, and anything else with a number of 1-7. I checked with my local recycling plant, check with yours before you trash the plastics you have. Once again, avoiding plastics to begin with is better, but if you have them at least try to recycle them.
21) Compost! Food in landfills don’t break down well and end up producing methane.
22) They make slightly more sustainable cotton swabs that really aren’t more expensive than the regular. I personally don’t favor the reusable silicone ones.
23) This one’s tiny and a given, but I’ll still say it—reusable straws.
24) Stop buying napkins and paper towels, use reusable napkins and rags instead
25) Also a given, but—reusable shopping bags are a must. /any bag that won’t break on you, you don’t have to go out and buy new things.
26) If you buy produce/veggies, buy them individually (instead of in prepackaged plastic) and use reusable mesh baggies.
27) Buy cleaning concentrates that mix with water in reusable bottles instead of buying pre-made stuff.
28) Make the switch to plant milk instead of dairy, or at least lower your consumption of dairy (Say you buy 1 gallon of milk a week, maybe switch to half a gallon regular milk and half a gallon plant milk).
29) If you have the time and energy, make your own snacks instead of buying prepackaged ones. For example, air pop your own popcorn kernals instead of buying microwave popcorn.
30) Buy jam/jelly in glass containers instead of plastic. Same goes for pasta sauce and, well, anything else that comes in a jar.
31) Bulk stores, if they happen to be near you, are your friend.
32) Borrow/rent instead of buying when you can, such as suits or dresses.

Against-EV,"1.) Do I actually need this?

2.) Have I asked anyone to give it to me for free or trade? ->

3.) Can I buy it second-hand?

if no -> 4.) Do I actually need the item?

&#x200B;

For me, I have a standard. Either items have to become a sustainable asset long-term or they have to bring me closer to personal resiliency or community dependency. I prefer secondhand and ""beyond sustainable"" items but that isn't always possible.

An example would be building a biodigester so I can produce my own fertilizer,  methane for cooking, and process all of my food wastes including bones, meat, and dairy.

The container for the biodigester isn't sustainable material, it is made of plastic. But the container has already been created and was used for transporting vegetable oil. So buying it second-hand saves money, diverts the waste from the landfill, and can be an asset long term.

Assuming I produce the fertilizer at a higher rate than my system can consume it,  it would become a pollutant. But if I can sell it, or give it away for another form of capital that isn't financial, then it is an asset. Also, I will be able to produce methane from it which will be used with a propane stovetop instead of my electric cooking stove.

More generally I would say that I support the purchasing or trading of items that give zero economic feedback to the system; so I'm not telling the economy to produce more goods.

Of course, there are some things I won't buy second-hand, like underwear. But almost everything else can be had for a lower cost than retail prices, found second hand, repaired for little money, obtain freely, or traded for something -> often times a different form of capital.

The long-term goal is to limit consumption of goods, products, and services and instead to be a producer of goods, products, and services required for my own basic survival.

But again, this isn't practical for all things; especially where children are involved.",actually asked anyone give free trade buy secondhand actually item standard either item become sustainable asset longterm bring closer personal resiliency community dependency prefer secondhand beyond sustainable item always possible example building biodigester produce fertilizer methane cooking process food waste including bone meat dairy container biodigester sustainable material made plastic container already created used transporting vegetable oil buying secondhand save money diverts waste landfill asset long term assuming produce fertilizer higher rate system consume become pollutant sell give away another form capital financial asset able produce methane used propane stovetop instead cooking stove generally say support purchasing trading item give zero economic feedback system telling economy produce good course buy secondhand underwear almost everything else lower cost retail price found second hand repaired little money obtain freely traded something often time different form capital longterm goal limit consumption good product service instead producer good product service required basic survival practical especially child involved,153

Then the lot of one grocery store was redeveloped. It turned into condos above (good), and shops/ restaurants below, but none of the shop spaces is big enough for a full service grocery store. There’s a fancy health food store with $10 bottles of organic milk, that must be processed by virgins or something, and all the GF food you can shake a stick at, a high end sit down Neapolitan pizzeria,  a similarly high end Japanese restaurant, a small drugstore, and a very exclusive pet supply store.

Just be sure not to get scammed lol, perhaps stick to shopping in your continent. I also know this isn’t necessarily an option if you don’t have the money.
2) Stop eating meat. If you can’t make the commitment, maybe start flexitarian, then pescatarian, then vegetarian, then vegan if you’re able. 
3) Stop using plastic bags and cling wrap! They make great reusable silicone baggies and bowl/dish covers. The key here is silicone, although plastic is alright if that’s all you can afford. Once again, I recommend Etsy for low waste items like these.
4) Buy any new clothing, dishes, etc second-hand. A big piece of a sustainable earth is a circular economy. Don’t buy new unless you have to (but also, you’re human, don’t feel ashamed if you treat yourself once in a blue moon.
5) If you wash your face and/or need to remove makeup, use reusable cotton rounds with micellar water (for makeup removal) or cotton face towels. Basically, don’t use any single use items on your face anymore.
6) Switch to toothpaste in an aluminum tube, like Hey Human toothpaste (I think that’s the brand name?).
7) If you want a single serve drink, purchase the ones not in plastic. For example, if you need a pre-made coffee, buy Starbucks in the glass containers instead of Dunkin in the plastic. Same goes for teas and juices, Nantucket Nectars, Honest Tea, and Snapple are a toss up, sometimes they’re plastic but other times they are glass.
8) Bring a reusable cup when you get coffee or tea. I do admit this is less convenient and not very possible right now with the pandemic.
9) Refuse plastic silverware during takeout, bring your own from home or purchase non-plastic collapsible ones.
10) I could be off about this one, but from my experience, powder laundry detergent comes in less plastic than liquid. Plus, let’s be honest, the liquid is a waste of water. Alternatively they make eco-friendly pods or sheets, but that can get pricey fast imo.
11) Buy your chapstick and deodorant in compostable packaging. Some companies like Old Spice and Dove are slowly implementing this, but also you can look to Etsy.
12) See if any products you use have a return program, either with Terracyle or on their own. The production of plastic is bad in and of itself however this is a good way to get rid of the packaging you already have or that other people have who won’t make the switch.
13) Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shave cream…all of it can be found in bar form. If you’re interested, I can send you the link to the shampoo bar I use, it’s super amazing.
14) If you get soft plastic bags for any reason (bread, shopping, toilet paper packaging, etc) you can return them to most stores and they’ll get recycled. Usually there’s a spot for them next to the trash and regular recycling. Target, Walmart, and Costco all do bag recycling for sure.
15) Turn off lights when you don’t need them
16) If you have the money, opt for bamboo toilet paper.
17) Bring your own takeout containers to restaurants instead of using their single-use plastic/styrofoam ones
18) Donate and sell your old items before just trashing them, if you really must get rid of them to begin with
19) Buy in bulk, it’s less plastic overall. For example, if you eat yogurt, buy the large 48oz tub instead of the individual servings.
20) A lot of local  recycling programs (in the USA) accept most plastics nowadays. I’m talking shampoo bottles, cleaning supply bottles, plastic coffee cups, yogurt containers, and anything else with a number of 1-7. I checked with my local recycling plant, check with yours before you trash the plastics you have. Once again, avoiding plastics to begin with is better, but if you have them at least try to recycle them.
21) Compost! Food in landfills don’t break down well and end up producing methane.
22) They make slightly more sustainable cotton swabs that really aren’t more expensive than the regular. I personally don’t favor the reusable silicone ones.
23) This one’s tiny and a given, but I’ll still say it—reusable straws.
24) Stop buying napkins and paper towels, use reusable napkins and rags instead
25) Also a given, but—reusable shopping bags are a must. /any bag that won’t break on you, you don’t have to go out and buy new things.
26) If you buy produce/veggies, buy them individually (instead of in prepackaged plastic) and use reusable mesh baggies.
27) Buy cleaning concentrates that mix with water in reusable bottles instead of buying pre-made stuff.
28) Make the switch to plant milk instead of dairy, or at least lower your consumption of dairy (Say you buy 1 gallon of milk a week, maybe switch to half a gallon regular milk and half a gallon plant milk).
29) If you have the time and energy, make your own snacks instead of buying prepackaged ones. For example, air pop your own popcorn kernals instead of buying microwave popcorn.
30) Buy jam/jelly in glass containers instead of plastic. Same goes for pasta sauce and, well, anything else that comes in a jar.
31) Bulk stores, if they happen to be near you, are your friend.
32) Borrow/rent instead of buying when you can, such as suits or dresses.

Hope these help!

Existing nuclear will play a role for the next couple of decades, tops, as grid upgrades and new generation resources come online. 

However, I firmly believe we won't see the nuclear renaissance moving forward that so many in other subreddits are convinced is just around the corner. Economically and operationally, it just doesn't make sense in the United States to build new nuclear - which is why it's not happening.

Against-EV,"TL;DR at the bottom  


Heres the thing about EVs compared to gas cars as far as a foot print goes. In the beginning a gas car will produce less overall emissions from when its metal in the earth to when it rolls of the assembly line compared to an EV equivalent since lithium-ion batteries are not easy or clean to manufacture at the moment. So day one of owning either, the gas car is cleaner.   


Say you drive either for two years/ 10,000 miles (based on you driving roughly half of the average, for those of you who drive the average of about 12,000 miles thats only one year), in some circumstances the gasoline car will have produced slightly less overall footprint than the comparable gasoline car (it is heavily dependent on energy production and the car itself), but by year 3 or 4 (2/3 if you drive 12k\~ miles) the EV will almost always become cleaner than the gasoline car, because its environmental efficiency adds up in the fact it isn't directly burning fuel when driven compared to gas cars. That manufacturing footprint wont go away, but by now it is beating out the cost that would be incurred of driving a gas car is now more than the EVs foot print.   


To tie into your car, hybrids are still very clean. While an older Prius may not stack up as well compared to a newer hybrid or EV as the battery has aged, it's still a relatively green car. Even considering a new hybrid is worth the look as much as the EV, since many new plug-in hybrids (especially if you have short drive times) will run on battery power most of the time anyway, meaning that the reduction of emissions is still there almost as much as an EV.   


At the end in my opinion the question is how much do you need a new car. if you dont need one why waste money, but if you do need (or really want) a new car and have the money, both EVs and Hybrids are worth the look. There are also other alternative fuels (diesel, bio diesel, propane, hydrogen, E86, etc, which all have ups and downs), and i think most of these are worth considering.   


While the footprint of manufacturing an EV will likely be bigger than it will say 5 years from now, driving a gas car for 5 years will have a bigger footprint than the manufacturing cost to the environment since they produce larger yearly emissions (one source i found while writing the paper this is based on put gas sedans at about 5.2 tons of CO2 per year and a comparable EV at 2 tons per year. Manufacturing is much different, it can range so far so it is hard to calculate).   


My personal opinion: If you are set on replacing your car, looking at new or used hybrids and EVs are both good options, but if you cant find something that works, an efficient gasoline is not the end of the world. Well, at least just one of them wont be.   
TL;DR : In the long run, an EV would be cleaner than buying and driving a gas car now and waiting for the overall footprint of EV manufacturing to reduce itself. Another great option is (plug in) hybrids, as they tend to have a good middle ground and in many cases will function like an EV since the battery has enough power to get most places.",tldr bottom compared gas far foot print go beginning gas produce less overall emission metal earth roll assembly line compared equivalent since lithiumion easy clean manufacture moment day owning either gas cleaner say drive either two mile based driving roughly half average drive average mile circumstance gasoline produced slightly less overall footprint comparable gasoline heavily dependent production drive k mile almost always become cleaner gasoline environmental efficiency add fact directly burning fuel driven compared gas manufacturing footprint go away beating cost incurred driving gas foot print tie hybrid still clean older prius may stack well compared newer hybrid aged still relatively green even considering hybrid worth look much since many plugin hybrid especially short drive time run power time anyway meaning reduction emission still almost much end opinion question much waste money really want money hybrid worth look alternative fuel diesel bio diesel propane hydrogen e etc ups down think worth considering footprint manufacturing likely bigger say driving gas bigger footprint manufacturing cost environment since produce larger yearly emission source found writing paper based put gas sedan ton co per comparable ton per manufacturing much different range far hard calculate personal opinion set replacing looking used hybrid good option find something work efficient gasoline end world well least tldr long run cleaner buying driving gas waiting overall footprint manufacturing reduce another great option plug hybrid tend good middle ground many case function since enough power place,236

Against-EV,"Perhaps the most salient field of research to your needs is automotive lifecycle analysis research.  [This](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es903729a) lifecycle analysis is my go-to, because it quantifies environmental impact using the EcoIndicator 99 benchmark, which captures ecosystem diversity loss, harm to human health, and resource quality loss.  This captures impacts that carbon footprint and energy use may not adequately portray.  

What is consistent between this LCA and carbon/energy use-based ones is that the large majority of any car's environmental impact occurs in operations, not manufacturing, meaning that fuel economy is the single largest determinant of any car's overall impact.  Based on this fact, if you're looking for another car with an eye to sustainability, your best bet will be a fully electric car, with hybrids cominig in second.  If you can secure a used EV, that will be preferable over new, but the lifecycle analyses show that even a new EV is preferable to an older gas car.",perhaps salient field research automotive lifecycle analysis research lifecycle analysis goto quantifies environmental impact using ecoindicator benchmark capture ecosystem diversity loss harm human health resource quality loss capture impact carbon footprint use may adequately portray consistent lca carbonenergy usebased large majority environmental impact occurs operation manufacturing meaning fuel economy single largest determinant overall impact based fact looking another eye sustainability best bet fully hybrid cominig second secure used preferable lifecycle analysis show even preferable older gas,76

Against-EV,">when you factor in the energy used and emissions created by their production it can end up being the same or worse for the environment than regular vehicles

This wasn't true [when those claims were first aimed at the Prius](https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/2kou6r/does_anyone_know_what_happens_to_the_batteries/clnlkue/), and this isn't true [for EVs now either](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903729a).

Against-EV,"Kinda hard to say without knowing where you live and how big a house you want. But

The fundamental rule is maximise south facing windows, install eves to protect from the sun in summer and minimise all other windows. 
This will maximise solar gain in winter and prevent it in summer.
Draft-stop and insulate to retain / prevent heat loss / gain.
Will be super comfortable without large temperature fluctuations.

Once that’s done look at your energy usage. Usually heating and cooling are highest.
For a farm, I’m guessing you’ve got heaps of wood around so a wood heater will be best and cheapest. Will last forever too.
Look into traditional heaters but also rocket stoves and  pellet burners.
Can even install a wet back system to heat your hot water in winter.
If your house is huge you could put in hydronic underfloor heating  powered by the wood burner to heat other parts of the house but this is quite expensive and maybe overkill depending how cold it gets where you are.

Solar EVT for hot water. Back it up with the wet back system.

LED lighting.

Induction cooking or wood stove.

Energy efficient appliances. Especially look for ones with a timer that you can time to come on when the sun is shining.

>The Union of Concerned Scientists did the best and most rigorous assessment of the carbon footprint of Tesla's and other electric vehicles vs internal combustion vehicles including hybrids. They found that the manufacturing of a full-sized Tesla Model S rear-wheel drive car with an 85 KWH battery was equivalent to a full-sized internal combustion car except for the battery, which added 15% or one metric ton of CO2 emissions to the total manufacturing.

>However, they found that this was trivial compared to the emissions avoided due to not burning fossil fuels to move the car. Before anyone says ""But electricity is generated from coal!"", they took that into account too, and it's included in the 53% overall reduction.
  
>And it's probably worth asking what happens to the battery at end of lifecycle. Answer: Tesla recycles it, recovering 70% of the carbon.

>“We’re shifting pollution, and in the process we’re hoping that it doesn’t have the environmental impact,” says Abraham. He believes that when you add all the environmental impacts, they still come out in favor of electric vehicles. (The Union of Concerned Scientists agrees; it found that even when you add in emissions from battery manufacturing, EVs generate half the emissions of a conventional car over the course of its life.) Still, consumers and investors should understand what it takes to make the materials that enable their green choices. “I don’t think there’s been much discussion of that,” Abraham says. “We can’t look at mining as an over-there thing and at Tesla as an over-here thing. They’re intricately linked.”

>Overall, “the greenhouse-gas-emissions footprint of electric vehicles can be pretty high on the front end, as they’re being built,” says McConnell. “And so you need to get a lot of benefits on the other side, when you use it.” And after you’re done using it.

Against-EV,"For some reason reddit is deleting the spaces between paragraphs. It's pretty hard to read in its current format so here's a shorter version:

The coal industry lost 50,000 jobs from 2008-2012. In that same period solar and wind power added 80,000 jobs. Wind and solar power are also getting far cheaper and more commercially viable than they used be. In 1977 the cost of solar was $76.67 per watt. In 2014 it costs a mere $0.49 per watt. That's an insane price reduction that consistently decreases every year. Even if no government action is taken to run the United States on renewable energy it’s clear to see how solar and wind power may just outcompete fossil fuel regardless. In another amazing example the relatively newly formed electric car (and now solar panel) company “Tesla” generated more money last quarter than the entire oil industry in the United States, who lost 67 billion dollars that same year.
	Taxing renewable energy sources, investing in fossil fuels, and deregulating businesses is a step backwards for America. Fossil fuels are a limited resource that will run dry, it doesn’t make sense to try and revive these industries. Imagine if all the near deserted oil fields in Texas and North Dakota were made into solar or wind farms. Imagine if solar panels or solar tiles were installed in the majority of homes in the United States, currently less than 1% of homes utilize solar power. There’s hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created in the renewable energy sector and hundreds of thousands of Americans that could reinvigorate the economy. Protecting the environment does not have to equal a loss of jobs, in fact just the opposite. The economy and the environment are entirely capable of growing side by side.

Against-EV,"This article talks a lot about ""car users"" and the cost of maintaining the roads by charging the drivers of cars for gasoline, and compares this with the more efficient use of transit of things like busses.  This ignores the fact that commercial vehicles pay a LOT more for the use of the roads than privately owned individual transport vehicles (cars) do.  A semi-truck or large panel van will get a quarter of the gas milage per gallon than a modern high MPG car will, and the diesel is taxed higher, because the tax administrators and legislators know that the businesses will pay whatever they have to for fuel, because their business depends on it.

Also, damage to the roadway (wear and tear) is done proportionally to the weight of the vehicle driving on it.  A 1 ton high efficiency car won't do anywhere near the damage to a road surface that a 40 ton delivery truck will.  So what it the car pays less in taxes?  It's the big commercial vehicles that are doing the damage, and that must have the roadways.

Do we expect groceries are going to be delivered on the subway? or via a bus?  Perhaps the delivery people will walk their deliveries from Kansas to New York City on sidewalks?  

No, there is a real reason why roads exist still, and why they will continue to be needed.  Sure, it would be great to see more urban people taking mass transit.  You guys might get your wish - much, much higher taxes on fuels, leading to much lower use of the roadways.

Against-EV,"As far as I know, most hydrogen fuel cell vehicles use a Series Hybrid system. A vehicle can't run straight on a fuel cell without a battery pack as a buffer because a fuel cell can't handle sudden changes in load (like accelerating and braking frequently etc), while batteries can.
At my university (HAN Automotive) we have a Fiat Doblo running on a fuel cell which is used as a range extender for the battery pack (so a series hybrid) and it works perfectly. Not sure about the range and top speed etc.

I think the main reason these vehicles don't have a larger battery pack is the extra weight it adds. Im not sure on the specifics but the more weight means more power is needed to accelerate etc meaning the benefit of having a lot more batteries decreases (I may be wrong here, this is just off the top of my head :P). 

Ill add that the advantage of using a fuel cell instead of a gasoline engine as a generator is that a fuel cell if far more efficient at producing electricity than a combustion engine is. A fuel cell directly converts hydrogen into electricity while a combustion engine turns the fuel into heat, then kinetic energy and then finally electricity through the alternator. These extra steps all have a loss leaving you with a far lower efficiency compared to a fuel cell.

California drives a lot, 340 billion miles a year.

340 billion miles is 550 billion km.

550 billion km per year is 1.5 billion km per day.

A Tesla Model Y uses about 17.3 kWh per 100 km.

Thus 8 million Y's will use 260 million kWh per day, or 260 GWh per day.

California currently (well, 2020) averages about 2300 GWh per day. **UPDATE:** sorry, that's monthly hydro only and they changed the units. The correct number is 80 GWp x 24 hours = 1920 GWh per day.

Thus EVing the fleet will have marginal impact.

The same is true for everywhere I've run the numbers.

Here in Canada, for instance, EVing every single car and light truck will not even use up the spare capacity in the last hydro dam on the Grande Baleine in Quebec.

IDCs **are** expenses and shouldn't be capitalized. [From the CFRB:](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/tax-break-down-intangible-drilling-costs)

>Intangible drilling costs are defined as costs related to drilling and necessary for the preparation of wells for production, but that have no salvageable value. These include costs for wages, fuel, supplies, repairs, survey work, and ground clearing. They compose roughly 60 to 80 percent of total drilling costs. 

Those things are expenses in **every other industry imaginable**. Why would fuel, for example, be counted as a capital expenditure? Why would wages? Survey work? It's ridiculous to suggest that those kind of expenses are part of the long term asset. The long term asset is the reserve itself. The costs associated with producing it are akin to the electricity and workers wages dedicated to running a factory.

Please, I would love to hear a financial argument for those costs being capitalized instead of expensed. 

>the accelerated amortization period for geological and geophysical expenses

This can be done away with, but want to point out something: this only applies to non majors. Exxon, Chevron, shell, BP, and Total have to amortize over 7 years, the normal period. If you own a 15% or bigger portion of s refinery, and you produce significant quantities of oil, this benefit doesn't apply to you. So basically a subsidy to help smaller producers compete against oil majors.

>percentage depletion allowance

Just for starters, the article says that the electricity to run a BEV is just as polluting as an ICE in many markets. This is wrong. It's only as damaging as the processes used to generate the electricity, so as renewable energy continues to grow both directly and as a percentage of total generation, those cars will perforce become less polluting. The article ignored this fact entirely.

The article also ignored the fact that transportation is the single biggest user of fossil fuels. As various parts of this transportation infrastructure are converted, the energy use will fall dramatically and so will pollution.

Against-EV,"This actually makes sense.

I've put forth the PHEV using fuel cells or other generators to extend range many times, and been of the view that the PHEV is better than an all BEV design in many cases, and that it should be integrated into national energy policy - for example PHEV's allow car chargers to shed load in mid winter but remain operational to spare electricity for heating.

However, I still would favour a liquid hydrocarbon rather than H2 for the PHEV range extender, something like an SOFC burning bio-oil or HC's reformed from agricultural waste. The range extender although can be included in the vehicle is best conceived as a module that could be hired, and if one does not need to travel far it can be used as a CHP system if kept at home, both heating the home and charging the car at night during times of grid stress in winter.

The reason is that PHEV's or BEV's using a domestic CHP charger burning a hydrocarbon become strategically most useful to support nations which have large seasonal variation in demand and inverse renewable supply. This almost unavoidably means we need a way to power vehicles with fuel - which needs to be carbon neutral, and can be stored inter-seasonally (difficult in quantity with H2), to support the grid and the transportation sector. Range extender modules could be left at home to further lighten the vehicle when trips are short, rented if need be for longer journeys, and ideally integrated into a domestic CHP system to charge the vehicle whilst parked at night.

The actual amount of waste biomass that can be converted to hydrocarbons is quite significant, the goal of the battery is to replace say >90% of vehicle miles that require fuel directly, with 100% green electricity. The remainder can be met by existing waste streams. Beyond that there is also synthetic hydrocarbons derived from atmospheric CO2.

But H2 still serves a good purpose here in reducing overall battery mass and potentially vehicle mass, so could increase the average range per kWh of the vehicle.",actually sense put forth phev using fuel cell generator extend range many time view phev better bev design many case integrated national policy example phevs allow charger load mid winter remain operational spare electricity heating however still favour liquid hydrocarbon rather h phev range extender something sofc burning biooil hcs reformed agricultural waste range extender although included best conceived module could hired travel far used chp system kept home heating home charging night time grid stress winter reason phevs bevs using domestic chp charger burning hydrocarbon become strategically useful support nation large seasonal variation demand inverse renewable supply almost unavoidably mean way power fuel carbon neutral stored interseasonally difficult quantity h support grid transportation sector range extender module could left home lighten trip short rented longer journey ideally integrated domestic chp system charge whilst parked night actual amount waste biomass converted hydrocarbon quite significant goal replace say mile require fuel directly green electricity remainder met existing waste stream beyond synthetic hydrocarbon derived atmospheric co h still serf good purpose reducing overall mass potentially mass could increase average range per kwh,180

Against-EV,"I don't know if there's a niche for some-sort-of-nuclear baseload, but I can try to make the case that it's not inherently ridiculous. Short version is ""covering 50% of power with sustainable + storage is easy, covering 99% is very, very hard.""

I divide [grid electricity] storage into four categories from easiest-to-make-money to hardest. ""Typical day duck curve"", ""typical day overnight"", ""atypical day/week/month"" and ""seasonal"". 

For a typical day, it relatively easy and cheap to replace fossil fuel with sustainable + storage over the [duck curve](https://www.caiso.com/Documents/FlexibleResourcesHelpRenewables_FastFacts.pdf) . You need very roughly 5% of a full day's usage, a little over an hour. [""relatively"" is an important phrase; that's ~500 GWh of storage.] You get to use that almost every day, and depending on how the duck curve looks you might get to use it twice a day (morning and evening). 

On a typical day, you can also loadshift some solar [or wind] and cover the nighttime hours. That takes a lot more storage - maybe ""eight average hours"" or ~3500 GWh for the US- but you still get to use it on all the typical days. So 300 cycles a year, maybe. You can still make money on that. 

Now we're in the Pareto problem area - the 20% of the problem that costs 80% of the money. One part of this is a cold, cloudy, low-wind week. Or three. It's not really ""emergency"" because it happens a couple times a year and it's not really a surprise, but you need something that can handle full load, possibly for hundreds of hours. ""Atypical conditions"" isn't a great phrase but it's the best I could come up with. 

The other is seasonal - for instance, winter might have 20% less solar than spring and 20% more demand. This is a terrible match for storage because it's one or two cycles a YEAR at two thousand hours per cycle. 

There are a number of possible solutions to high-power,long-duration cases and nuclear may have a niche there.

Against-EV,">In 2010, 95% of US households owned a car & 85% drove to work. Post WWII, 40% didn't own cars. If no major energy & climate policies pass, vehicles & use of fuels will keep rising & more than double by 2050.

I see the logic that is struggling to get out here...  Back in the post-war boom of the '50s, the cost of a new car dropped until it was pretty much the same as it is today: about half the median wage, adjusted for income inflation.  Car ownership has doubled in the last 50 years, and would double again during the next 50 years, except... if almost 100% of the population already owns cars, then the domestic market is already pretty much saturated.  

I am employed in the field of renewable energy and sustainable housing.  I know that at this particular point, electric vehicles are still not a great option due to our very limited battery technologies and the fact that most of our electricity comes from less-than-desirable sources such as coal and nuclear.  It'll be a good long while before renewable energy catches up, even if today we committed to going with 100% renewables.  

For now, the solution is to change our driving habits and to invest in lighter-duty vehicles.  Cities should be aggressively pursuing advanced public transit systems and bicycle infrastructure.  We need to accept and develop self-driving vehicles to reduce the number of accidents, thus reducing the need and desire to drive heavy vehicles.  Self-driving vehicles also can operate more efficiently, and should effectively eliminate gridlock.  

We also need to apply our knowledge in fuel efficiency.  The US gov't has mandated almost a doubling of fuel efficiency standards over the next 13 years to 55 MPG, which about the mileage that a Prius can achieve.  But did you know that Volkswagon is currently developing a production car that reportedly gets 235 MPG?  Or that you can build a kit car for around $10,000 that gets 125 MPG?

Against-EV,"As far as I know, most hydrogen fuel cell vehicles use a Series Hybrid system. A vehicle can't run straight on a fuel cell without a battery pack as a buffer because a fuel cell can't handle sudden changes in load (like accelerating and braking frequently etc), while batteries can.
At my university (HAN Automotive) we have a Fiat Doblo running on a fuel cell which is used as a range extender for the battery pack (so a series hybrid) and it works perfectly. Not sure about the range and top speed etc.

I think the main reason these vehicles don't have a larger battery pack is the extra weight it adds. Im not sure on the specifics but the more weight means more power is needed to accelerate etc meaning the benefit of having a lot more batteries decreases (I may be wrong here, this is just off the top of my head :P). 

Ill add that the advantage of using a fuel cell instead of a gasoline engine as a generator is that a fuel cell if far more efficient at producing electricity than a combustion engine is. A fuel cell directly converts hydrogen into electricity while a combustion engine turns the fuel into heat, then kinetic energy and then finally electricity through the alternator. These extra steps all have a loss leaving you with a far lower efficiency compared to a fuel cell.

Against-EV,"[Trolleybuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolleybus) are probably the closest match to what you're thinking of. They draw power from overhead lines, but they can run on regular roads without tracks. That makes it fairly easy to introduce them onto a road where you also have non-electric traffic. 

They have a flexible connection to the overhead wires, so they're able to switch from one lane to another just like any other vehicle. That means you don't have to add tracks, and tracks really are a problem. Vehicles on tracks have to have their own lanes. In an existing city, you can't just add lanes to roads. There are buildings and sidewalks on either side, so adding a lane for a track means either removing a lane for other vehicles or completely remodeling that part of the city by demolishing and rebuilding buildings and sidewalks.

If there were a system to conveniently allow vehicles to get on and off of the overhead electric grid, then I could see a possibility for electric cars to just recharge as they're driving. That way, a battery range of just 100 miles would be no problem, because you'd only start using the batteries when you get off of the electrified roads. If all of the highways were electrified, then your 100 mile limit would only start to count when you're driving around neighborhoods, parking lots and scenic routes, so a 10-20 mile range would probably be sufficient.

The only major problem I can think of with this sort of implementation is the possibility of poorly-maintained vehicles damaging the wires. Since trolleybuses are usually owned by the same company or government body which owns the overhead wires, the buses are maintained as needed to minimize damage to the wires. What would happen to the wires if there were private vehicles using them, and some of the vehicles were owned by recently unemployed people who couldn't afford appropriate maintenance?",trolleybus probably closest match thinking draw power overhead line run regular road without track fairly easy introduce onto road nonelectric traffic flexible connection overhead wire able switch lane another mean add track track really problem track lane existing city add lane road building sidewalk either side adding lane track mean either removing lane completely remodeling part city demolishing rebuilding building sidewalk system conveniently allow overhead grid could see possibility recharge driving way range mile problem start using electrified road highway electrified mile limit start count driving around neighborhood parking lot scenic route mile range probably sufficient major problem think sort implementation possibility poorlymaintained damaging wire since trolleybus usually owned government body owns overhead wire bus maintained needed minimize damage wire happen wire private using owned recently unemployed could afford appropriate maintenance,131
